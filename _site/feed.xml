    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, in February 2015, I got an email from Francesca Coppa saying the Vancouver Art Gallery was putting together a massive exhibition on the modern history of mashups and she had been invited to curate a section on fan vidding. My multifandom vid “Starships!” had made her shortlist along with &lt;a href=&quot;#screening&quot;&gt;six vids by five other vidders&lt;/a&gt;, and she wanted to know if it would be all right to include it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the story of what followed: from deciding which name to choose and what to do about the possibility of being sued, to watching the exhibition transform from abstract concept to really-real event, to visiting the gallery on opening night and observing “Muggles” interact with these half-dozen vids mounted on the wall around the corner from works by Andy Warhol and Frank Gehry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Some parts will be familiar if you read my Dreamwidth recap of the visit, but other material is new.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to navigate among sections in whatever order you like or follow the suggested path—and be sure to check out the contributions from some of the other exhibited vidders!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;to-show-or-not-to-show&quot;&gt;To Show, or Not to Show:&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When the invitation came to participate in the exhibit, I wanted to jump up and down in my chair and say, “Yes! Of course!” My vid! In a museum! Somehow “Starships!” had made the cut alongside works by the person credited with starting the entire vidding tradition, Kandy Fong, and other big-name vidders whose vids are used as case studies in fighting for copyright exemption and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I had one hesitation: I didn’t want to get sued, and I didn’t know how to assess the risk or prepare for defense. Posting “Starships!” online was one thing; if a copyright holder started giving me grief, I could simply take it down. But giving permission to a museum to hang it on a wall felt like another thing entirely. I’d heard about other exhibits that featured vids before, like &lt;a href=&quot;www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2013/06/29/detail/cut-up/&quot;&gt;Cut Up&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movingimage.us/&quot;&gt;Museum of the Moving Image&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, and nothing bad seemed to have happened around those, but I didn’t know the behind-the-scenes legal details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My questions boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If someone visited the exhibit and had a copyright problem with the use of the song (or the clips, although those are easier to defend as transformative) in the vid, would the museum take a role in its defense?  Would the &lt;a href=&quot;www.transformativeworks.org/&quot;&gt;OTW&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Did I have the ability to grant rights to use the vid’s contents in advertising materials, as requested in the contract the museum had sent?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Would accepting the artist’s fee the museum was offering negate future invocation of fair use, since profit was made?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I ended up consulting with three people: Francesca Coppa, one of the Vancouver Art Gallery exhibit curators, and the former Legal chair of the OTW. Here is what they said that gave me more context and ultimately made me feel comfortable enough to say yes. This is all paraphrased and obviously shouldn’t be taken as direct quotes or legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the U.S., fair use and profit aren’t mutually exclusive. The bar for proving transformativity is higher for commercial uses, but that’s more like if someone wanted to sell their own Harry Potter novel. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The exhibit will take place in Canada, where noncommercial remixes are exempt from copyright law as part of the user-generated content (UGC) exception or “&lt;a href=&quot;www.teresascassa.ca/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;amp;view=item&amp;amp;id=128:user-generated-content-under-canadian-copyright-law&quot;&gt;The YouTube exception&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It’s unclear whether accepting the museum’s honorarium takes the vid out of a noncommercial context. You could argue not, since the work was made noncommercially and the exhibit is for educational/artistic purposes; we’re not selling the vids.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The risk approaches zero if you don’t take the honorarium, and is still minimal if you do—likely lower than the risk you’ve already taken of sharing the vid online, given its popularity. This is the first time I can remember a museum offering vidders a fee; why not take advantage? &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every work in the exhibition will include appropriated content in one way or another, so it’s not like the vids will stand out in this regard. We have a lengthy history of exhibiting this type of work and have never had any problems. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Could someone sue? Yes. Could they win? No.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have any assets in Canada, it’s hard for Canada to do anything to you. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If this were in the U.S., it would be a question of fair use. You could make a good case for it.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The OTW exists in part to help with cases like that in the U.S. That said, nothing has happened so far.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some institutions have blanket licenses to play music. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Showing vids in museum exhibitions has actually helped bolster arguments that vids are clear fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What I heard was that Canadian rules applied over U.S. rules, the risk was low, and if something were to happen, I would have some help. I decided to accept. As I said to Francesca: It’s about time I put my money where my mouth is in terms of standing up for the rights of fan creators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So I decided &lt;a href=&quot;#crisis&quot;&gt;which name to use&lt;/a&gt;, signed the contract, later cashed the check—which wasn’t a gigantic amount but basically covered my hotel stay when the exhibit opened; &lt;a href=&quot;#opening&quot;&gt;more on that&lt;/a&gt; in a minute-—and never faced a copyright challenge. In fact, the worst that happened is that now, one year later, I have to properly figure it into my taxes: “income from activities not engaged in for profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#crisis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Identity Crisis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;crisis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;identity-crisis&quot;&gt;Identity Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After easing my &lt;a href=&quot;#legal&quot;&gt;worries about litigation&lt;/a&gt;, the question remained of which name to use in the gallery materials and on the curator’s card that would hang next to the vid monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I mean, “bironic” was the obvious choice, right? It’s the name on the vid and my name in fandom. But going that route meant closing some doors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It meant limiting the people I felt comfortable talking to about the exhibit. I couldn’t post about it on Facebook because that would break down the wall between my real-life and fannish identities that I’ve worked so hard over the last 10-plus years to reinforce. I couldn’t talk about it openly at work because people would ask to see the vid and then they would know my pseudonym and two enterprising clicks later could read my porn and public journal entries. (I prefer those entries to remain public for several reasons, even when they’re about intimate topics, but my comfort level is linked to remaining anonymous. The age-old dilemma.) Similarly, it’s not something I can put on my résumé without bracing for questions that invite awkward, evasive answers. No excited sharing of the initial news; no pictures when I took the trip to Vancouver. There’s only a small Venn diagram of people to whom I can show that photo above, unedited.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It meant losing an opportunity for minor “fame” by not having my real name in gallery materials. I admit it did give me a pang when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_mashup1.html&quot;&gt;exhibit website&lt;/a&gt; went &lt;a href=&quot;#real&quot;&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;promo materials&lt;/a&gt; started coming out and I saw all these World-Famous Artists’ names and thought, &lt;em&gt;My name could have been there among them&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, bironic is my name, in a way, but it’s not quite the same. Nor is it the name most people in my offline life would recognize. If an old friend or teacher came across those museum ads in the wild, they wouldn’t email me in excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So, you know, ego stuff. And some other repercussions, some of them amusing. I had to take care when filling out the paperwork, signing the contract with my fannish name, filling out a supplemental form with my legal name, address, etc., and adding a hand-written note reminding the curators and whomever to please keep the two identities separate. (Francesca had already talked to them about that for all of us, and that’s why she initially acted as intermediary. She also offered to mediate if any of the vidders wanted to, for example, accept the fee but not share their RL info.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A sort of funny consequence was that half a year later when the curators sent out invitations to attend the exhibit opening, I RSVP’d with my real name (I think?) and someone didn’t make the connection, so they didn’t realize I was coming until &lt;a href=&quot;#opening&quot;&gt;I showed up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other funny thing was that one of the curatorial assistants inadvertently confirmed that my ongoing attempts to keep RL and fannish identities distinct were working, because she sent this note after trying to, I assume, find out by Googling “bironic”:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;For the exhibition labels, it is our house standard to include year and place of birth next to the artist's name but I haven't been able to find this information for you online. Could you please send me this information at your earliest convenience? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(I didn’t realize it was for the card on the wall, so I was vague and said “New York,” and that is the exciting story of how my birthplace was cited… not quite accurately.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Whenever any of these downsides presented themselves, though, I took comfort in the fact that everyone else in the vidding exhibit went with their fannish names. And I was still able to share the thrill of the experience with people in my life who matter a lot to me: my family, my RL friends who know about this hobby, and all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I always say yes, on principle, in that in my view I’ve already released the vid onto the internet - it’s out there, you know? I put it out there! On Youtube and so on - No sense in denying it! :P A lot of people don’t ask anyway - just go ahead and show the vid, which I approve of because it’s no hassle to me then. And sometimes I discover they have, and that’s a nice surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;[…] I don’t actively take on the agenda of whoever is showing a vid. The show is theirs and the vid is just material for it. I don’t feel like it flows upstream to me. I don’t really think any of it has much to do with me. I am really concerned with the making of vids, not the watching of them. (I’m not a good vid watcher!) And I don’t really spend much time thinking/imagining other people watching my vids, either. I know they do, from time to time, and when they write posts or recs (or anti-recs) I often read those with great interest. But I’m really interested, there, in how the vid bounces off that other person. What they bring to the table. That’s the part that’s interesting to me, not so much, hm, I’m not using the audience as a mirror, if that makes sense. It doesn’t work for me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The very first time a vid of mine was exhibited outside fandom - for Mediated at the California Museum of Photography in like 2008 - I had a very different response, I think. I found it quite brutal. I was much newer to vidding and I am quite shy anyway and found the attention uncomfortable - it was a vid I had made in only my first year of vidding and it was a bit overwhelming and complicated to navigate. But I am old now and don’t care, hahah. […]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Anyway, [Mediated] was uncomfortable in some ways but the discomfort was quite generative: at that time I thought a lot about how I would show vids, if I were to show them, and maybe I’ll do that someday actually - put on a show that’s ALL vids and sensible of the particular aesthetics of vidding. We should do that some day. It would be fun. It’s percolating.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Months after signing the contracts, sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop—because how could something this cool really happen, or happen without complications—it finally felt real. Somehow I had created something that someone thought worth including in this exhibit. Somehow Francesa considered “Starships!” on a level with works by Kandy Fong and obsessive24 and here’s luck and Lim and Shadow Songs, at least in a collection themed around the progression of mashups. WTF, right? &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(I wasn’t the &lt;a href=&quot;heresluck.dreamwidth.org/1056687.html&quot;&gt;only one excited&lt;/a&gt;, either, which helped me feel less silly!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And then, even more good news: Even though the gallery itself was not able to provide travel funds to participants, between the artist’s fee and an unexpected holiday gift from my mom I was suddenly in a position to fly to Vancouver and see the exhibit in person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There was some conferring amongst the vidders and Ces about arranging to meet there, on opening night or some other weekend before our part of the exhibit closed that June, but schedules and finances and logistics and other matters got in the way. I made an executive decision to RSVP for myself, at least, before fares rose too high, and I’m so glad I did, since no one else was able to make it, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#luck&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Special exhibit: Here's Luck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

Special Exhibit:  Here's&amp;nbsp;Luck&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&quot;special-exhibit-heres-luck-2017&quot;&gt;Special Exhibit: Here’s Luck (2017)&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Francesca first emailed us to ask us to contribute, I was thrilled and delighted and said yes immediately. I know at least one of the other vidders was more anxious, for legal reasons, but given the OTW’s recent work to secure DMCA exemptions for vidders and other fannish remixers, which has done a lot to establish vidding as a fair rather than infringing use of copyrighted material, I wasn’t at all concerned about that. And the fact that we were being approached about showing vids in an art exhibit felt really momentous to me. Over the last ten years, vidding has been getting increased attention in fan studies circles and even to some extent media studies more generally, but quite a bit of that attention has been focused more on vids as evidence of audience activity than on vids as art. So to be included in a major exhibit that puts vids not in a fannish context but in the context of 20th and 21st century art – and in a subcollection curated by Francesca, who’s done more than anyone to make the argument that vids are art and ought to be understood as art – was really, really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It was so exciting that in some ways it didn’t even feel real, at first! But then as we began to get details about the exhibit, it did start to feel real – and overwhelming! Having my name, our names, on the list of exhibitors along with names like Pablo Picasso, T.S. Eliot, Barbara Kruger, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Byrne, Danger Mouse, Girl Talk, DJ Spooky – it’s not just that these are big names, but that they’re artists whose work I know and admire! Actually, for me, the most head-spinning co-exhibitor was Negativland: I loved Negativland in college, saw them play live on campus, wore the concert t-shirt all the time, wore out my tapes of Escape From Noise and Helter Stupid… Their music was probably my first exposure to multimedia remix and certainly their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland#U2_record_incident&quot;&gt;legal wrangle with Island Records&lt;/a&gt; over the U2 EP (“I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” now with kazoos!) was my first encounter with debates over transformative re-use of copyrighted and trademarked material.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But in some ways the most amazing and overwhelming part was being included with these amazing vidders. I originally got into vidding in the early 2000s without any sense of its history; vidding was important to me personally and creatively – it became my main creative outlet, it’s how I met a lot of the people I was (and am) closest to in fandom. But as I learned more about the history of vidding and our fannish foremothers, and as I started to get a better sense of all the different vidding traditions and aesthetics and styles and approaches that are out there, I started to feel like I was connected to something much bigger than just my little group of vid-loving fannish friends. There are so many of us doing so many amazing different things! So to have my work tapped to help represent vids and vidders and vidding is an immense honor. And to be in company with people like Kandy Fong, who invented vidding, and Lim, whose work blows my mind, and Obsessive24, whom I admire so much and have learned so much from, and [bironic] and Shadow Songs, who’ve made these vids that I just adore… it’s mind-blowing, in the best possible way.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#opening&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Opening Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;opening&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;opening-night&quot;&gt;Opening Night&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At last, February 19 in Vancouver: mountains and maritime air, unbelievable sushi, fringe theater, and the “VIP” reception the night before the MashUp exhibit opened to the public. I was sad and a bit nervous to be the only vidder there amongst strangers with their arty outfits and/or deep pockets. Let us not discuss how long it took to figure out what to wear. But it turned out fine!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While everyone was still corralled in the entry room, I found a random staffer and asked if any of the curators were there. She introduced me to one of the three, Daina, who brought over the assistant curator, Stephanie, who was more closely involved in our section and who was a joy to talk to. Later they grabbed my elbow as I was passing by and introduced me to the last curator, Bruce. They all seemed happy to have me there and wanted to talk about Francesca, our section curator, and whether any of the other vidders would be coming at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Daina made me talk to a New York art dealer in a scarf, which really completed the gallery-opening experience, even if he preferred the tactile nature of mid-century collage and did not have much interest in digital work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/clapping.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/320/clapping.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/480/clapping.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/640/clapping.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/980/clapping.jpg 980w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/1280/clapping.jpg 1280w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/1600/clapping.jpg 1600w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Something unexpected happened during the opening speeches: Among other things, Bruce named the half dozen artists or so who had come to the opening and included me at the end! People seemed familiar with the names that had come before—UJINO, Liz Magor, I forget who else—based on applause, so maybe that’s why he prefaced mine with “And somebody you probably don’t know, but should…” (!!) Only he then said, at least to my anxious ears, “bee&lt;em&gt;mumble&lt;/em&gt;,” so I guess I lost my chance at fame. Anyway, I raised my hand and people clapped politely, and it all felt very surreal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After the speeches, they let us loose on the exhibit, which spanned the entirety of the four-floor building. Naturally, I ran up to snap some pictures of &lt;a href=&quot;#wall&quot;&gt;our section&lt;/a&gt; first. Then I &lt;a href=&quot;#impressions&quot;&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; the top floors and came back to the vidding hall when actual people were there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#impressions&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Impressions of the MashUp exhibit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Describing the experience of walking through this giant multimedia exhibition on the history of 20th-21st century mashups felt daunting until I realized I don’t actually have to write an essay on that history and the place of vidding within it, nor an analysis of the objects the curators chose for inclusion and the way they organized the collection, because the gallery website and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.vanartgallery.bc.ca/collections/publications/products/mashup-the-birth-of-modern-culture&quot;&gt;350-page exhibit guide&lt;/a&gt; already took care of that, as did various articles online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(If you click on the tabs for each floor at that gallery link, there’s even more in-depth text.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Suffice to say that it was satisfying to see the curators acknowledge fan vidding as a notable form of remixing with artistic merit worthy of being placed alongside household names like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Brian Eno. Fanfiction and especially the annual Remix Redux would have had a home as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Starting on the fourth floor and working down provided a more or less chronological tour through the many ways people have appropriated existing media materials and subverted, built on or otherwise transformed them into something new and wonderful. I nodded at familiar examples of fan practice’s cousins (e.g. Jamaican dub, William S. Burroughs’ cut-ups, T.S. Eliot’s dense intertextuality, Quentin Tarantino’s metacommentary on film history) and ancestors (e.g. Victorian photo collage, by women, fittingly*) and learned a lot about other fascinating members of the family tree both close and distant. I was particularly entranced by a sound poem written and recited by Kurt Schwitters presented alongside a song version composed by Brian Eno, Kurt’s Rejoinder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Little change through time of the kinds of critique, censorship, copyright battles and celebration that their—our—works have engendered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;mid copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d been worried about how male-centric the exhibit would be, based on promo materials and early exhibit descriptions, so I was glad to see that it paid homage to the critical contributions of women from the very beginning. The introductory curator’s card on the top floor began with Georges Braque and Picasso, but then in the second paragraph, there were the women collage-makers. Cuttin’ up ur magazines, shakin’ up ur art. &lt;q&gt;These collages were often enclosed in personal albums, made more for the amusement of small social circles than for wider public exhibition and appreciation&lt;/q&gt; —sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While gender wasn’t balanced overall, many women were nevertheless featured on each floor. More on that from &lt;a href=&quot;www.straight.com/arts/643691/mashup-reveals-pivotal-role-women-pioneering-modern-art-methods&quot;&gt;straight.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Heavy on Western work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wall&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Vids Onna Wall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;parallax viewport&quot; id=&quot;brick&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vids Onna Wall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;wall&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vidding subcollection was situated in a darkened corner on the third floor of the exhibit, past Warhol’s Marilyns and clips from Jean-Luc Godard films, and adjacent to a Jamaican dub sound studio, which I thought was perfect, thematically. Related sections on hip hop and on the Black and Latino LGBT community drag balls in NYC depicted in magazines and the movie Paris Is Burning were on the next floor down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/floorplan.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/320/floorplan.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/480/floorplan.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/640/floorplan.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/mashup/floorplan.jpg 920w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The layout of the vidding section was unfortunate in that four of the seven vid monitors were in a narrow hallway, so people had to either stand close to the screen if they wanted to put on the single pair of headphones mounted beneath each so others could pass through behind them, or else stand against the opposite wall and watch without sound. I saw visitors doing both.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other three vids, though, which were the earliest, Kandy Fong’s and Shadow Songs’, were in the larger vestibule-type corner where it was easier to congregate and linger. That’s also where the curatorial text on vidding as a whole was located.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if this part of the exhibit was always so dim, allowing, I imagine, the vids themselves to look vibrant, or if it was lit that way only for the opening reception. A few people did lean forward to squint at the curators’ cards. Anyway, that’s why the pictures are kind of crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I haunted the vidding area for probably 45-60 minutes on and off over the course of the evening to see how people behaved when they came over. Reactions seemed to run the gamut: Some kept walking, some glanced at a screen or two and continued on, some read the vidding description with interest, some watched whole or parts of vids without audio, some put on the headphones and did the same, some shared or tried to share the headphones with whomever they were with (some partners accepted and others refused), a few went from screen to screen and watched at least part of each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I wish we as a community could have stationed someone besides the docent in the room with a button that said “Ask me about vidding!” or something. For example, to explain how to do it “right.” But then, in the midst of an exhibit about remix, appropriation and subverting authorial intentions, who’s to say what “right” is?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;card&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This vid—shared prolifically through tens of thousands of online viewings—has benefited from the increased accessibility of the internet since the inception of vidding in the 1970s, and also draws on the history of the medium, establishing links to earlier vids such as “Data’s Dream” (1993), which also takes viewers on a journey through fantastical worlds. Both play to our emotions through strategic connections between imagery and aspects of the selected song.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The meticulous attention given to the details of the accompanying music—genre, song choice, tone, lyrics, musicality—is vital to the effectiveness of such popular vids in connecting with their viewers. The synchronicity of the recognizable and emotion-filled clips of starships paired with Nicki Minaj’s song “Starships” essentially produces an intense emotional response that directs the viewer not only to think about spaceships but to consider how we feel about spaceships and space travel.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;mid copy&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A friend asked later what I thought about the text on the “Starships!” placard. (“Were you, for example, consciously referencing ‘Data’s Dream’?”) I found myself approaching the description from a dispassionate perspective—after flailing over seeing it right there on the wall like a Real Artist exhibiting a Notable Work, that is—interested in how Ces had decided to frame the vid within the theme and chronological progression she was working to establish for this mini collection. I hadn’t thought of “Data’s Dream” as a work “Starships!” was responding to, but “Starships!” wouldn’t exist without the tradition of multifandom vids that came before it, and “Data’s Dream” is at the root of that tradition. Ces did a good job of tracing lineages, demonstrating evolution and making other connections among the vids she chose to represent vidding as mashup technique, and I think this one was on point. The second half of the description I think was important for explaining to visitors some of the basics of what vidders try to do, because based on the behavior of some of the people I saw, it wasn’t always intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If I had had the opportunity to change anything about the text, besides swapping “synchronicity” for the oft-confused “synchrony,” I would have asked for it to say “hundreds of thousands of views” instead of “tens”—not even to brag, but to have had a slightly more impressive number to show to people unfamiliar with vidding who might have thought it’s a thing that, like, five people do. Not that “Starships!” is anywhere near the top of vid view counts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/queue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see, but there are a lot of people on that sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After about three hours, when I couldn’t stand up any longer and had to go, more than 500 people had attended the event—and the line to get in still went down the block. There were so many attendees still pouring in, in fact, that I couldn’t even see all the installations on the ground floor because it was too crowded for me. Well, I had “museum brain” by that point as well. There were so many interesting things to see and watch and listen to and interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Back in 1974, I was part of the group that founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_United_Federation_of_Phoenix&quot;&gt;The United Federation of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, the longest running Star Trek club in the world. I met John Fong at the first meeting. He’d purchased some of the unused pieces of film left over after Gene Roddenberry edited the classic Star Trek episodes. I had the idea of using those unique pictures to create new ST stories. The first one used those pieces mounted as slides set to an audio-tape recording of a short story I’d written, plus a filk song, “What Do You Do With A Drunken Vulcan.” Due to the enthusiastic response of fans, and the active support of Gene Roddenberry, who not only gave me permission, but gave me more slides to use, I created hours of stories to show to fans.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Fast forward years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vividcon&quot;&gt;Vividcon&lt;/a&gt;, the vidders’ convention. They honored me as the mother of the fannish music video. I responded by contacting the earliest vidders, and with their help, created a two-part retrospective about the beginning of vidding. I thought that this would be of interest only to the fans who made videos. Then, I met Francesca Coppa, and found out about Fanlore and the fannish history project.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To my great surprise, other main-stream historians and academics became interested in our video history as part of popular culture. Universities started archiving our creations. Starting in 2013, Museums like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2013/06/29/detail/cut-up/&quot;&gt;Museum of the Moving Image&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, and the Vancouver Artgallery in Canada started featuring shows about Cut Ups and Mash-ups and included some of my music videos.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When I talk about my inclusion in these exhibits, I can’t help smiling or even chuckling. It is almost unbelievable to me, that something that I started doing so long ago as entertainment for fans, is now considered important enough to be in a museum show with work from artists like Andy Warhol and Picasso. I am so tickled, and feel deeply honored. Wow!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;exit&quot;&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;exit&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;through-the-gift-shop&quot;&gt;…through the Gift Shop&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So that is the story of how a vid that I rushed to put together in two weeks for Club Vivid in 2012 ended up in a museum show that I will half-disbelievingly boast about forever to… a small group of people who can know my fan identity and haven’t already heard the story. And also random strangers, such as Vancouver bus drivers and fellow hotel guests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What hindsight now, to recall the sudden void after rushing to get the vid done, having to wait from April to August to see how it went over at Vividcon, being afraid that someone else would make the same vid in the intervening months because the song was all over the charts and the choice of clips was not exactly subtle. Then, this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although it would have been better to have had friends along, I’m glad I was able to see it in person and share some of what the experience was like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a real boost in confidence and pride, both in my own vidding ability and in this corner of the external art world’s acknowledgement of the significance of our whole endeavor. I have also been deeply gratified to see little crumbs of evidence in the past year that our vids made an impression on a few visitors, at least some of whom were being introduced to vidding for the first time:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Absolutely loved so much stuff at the MASHUP show at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VanArtGallery&quot;&gt;@VanArtGallery&lt;/a&gt; but my favourite? “Starships” vid by Bironic &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/T7NL538ZkK&quot;&gt;https://t.co/T7NL538ZkK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Johnny (@bluefacedbeast) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bluefacedbeast/status/731652090724896768&quot;&gt;15 May 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not something of mine is ever included again, I look forward to seeing how vids and other fanworks continue to evolve in the public consciousness through exhibits like this one. One day we’ll move beyond those irritating thinkpieces that laugh at what fans do and be able to share with more of the world the true joy and value of vids and fic and podfic and fanart and crafts etc. etc.: as labors of love, as critique, as celebration, as community-building, as art.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, in February 2015, I got an email from Francesca Coppa saying the Vancouver Art Gallery was putting together a massive exhibition on the modern history of mashups and she had been invited to curate a section on fan vidding. My multifandom vid “Starships!” had made her shortlist along with &lt;a href=&quot;#screening&quot;&gt;six vids by five other vidders&lt;/a&gt;, and she wanted to know if it would be all right to include it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the story of what followed: from deciding which name to choose and what to do about the possibility of being sued, to watching the exhibition transform from abstract concept to really-real event, to visiting the gallery on opening night and observing “Muggles” interact with these half-dozen vids mounted on the wall around the corner from works by Andy Warhol and Frank Gehry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Some parts will be familiar if you read my Dreamwidth recap of the visit, but other material is new.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to navigate among sections in whatever order you like or follow the suggested path—and be sure to check out the contributions from some of the other exhibited vidders!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;to-show-or-not-to-show&quot;&gt;To Show, or Not to Show:&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When the invitation came to participate in the exhibit, I wanted to jump up and down in my chair and say, “Yes! Of course!” My vid! In a museum! Somehow “Starships!” had made the cut alongside works by the person credited with starting the entire vidding tradition, Kandy Fong, and other big-name vidders whose vids are used as case studies in fighting for copyright exemption and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I had one hesitation: I didn’t want to get sued, and I didn’t know how to assess the risk or prepare for defense. Posting “Starships!” online was one thing; if a copyright holder started giving me grief, I could simply take it down. But giving permission to a museum to hang it on a wall felt like another thing entirely. I’d heard about other exhibits that featured vids before, like &lt;a href=&quot;www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2013/06/29/detail/cut-up/&quot;&gt;Cut Up&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movingimage.us/&quot;&gt;Museum of the Moving Image&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, and nothing bad seemed to have happened around those, but I didn’t know the behind-the-scenes legal details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My questions boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If someone visited the exhibit and had a copyright problem with the use of the song (or the clips, although those are easier to defend as transformative) in the vid, would the museum take a role in its defense?  Would the &lt;a href=&quot;www.transformativeworks.org/&quot;&gt;OTW&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Did I have the ability to grant rights to use the vid’s contents in advertising materials, as requested in the contract the museum had sent?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Would accepting the artist’s fee the museum was offering negate future invocation of fair use, since profit was made?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I ended up consulting with three people: Francesca Coppa, one of the Vancouver Art Gallery exhibit curators, and the former Legal chair of the OTW. Here is what they said that gave me more context and ultimately made me feel comfortable enough to say yes. This is all paraphrased and obviously shouldn’t be taken as direct quotes or legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the U.S., fair use and profit aren’t mutually exclusive. The bar for proving transformativity is higher for commercial uses, but that’s more like if someone wanted to sell their own Harry Potter novel. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The exhibit will take place in Canada, where noncommercial remixes are exempt from copyright law as part of the user-generated content (UGC) exception or “&lt;a href=&quot;www.teresascassa.ca/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;amp;view=item&amp;amp;id=128:user-generated-content-under-canadian-copyright-law&quot;&gt;The YouTube exception&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It’s unclear whether accepting the museum’s honorarium takes the vid out of a noncommercial context. You could argue not, since the work was made noncommercially and the exhibit is for educational/artistic purposes; we’re not selling the vids.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The risk approaches zero if you don’t take the honorarium, and is still minimal if you do—likely lower than the risk you’ve already taken of sharing the vid online, given its popularity. This is the first time I can remember a museum offering vidders a fee; why not take advantage? &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every work in the exhibition will include appropriated content in one way or another, so it’s not like the vids will stand out in this regard. We have a lengthy history of exhibiting this type of work and have never had any problems. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Could someone sue? Yes. Could they win? No.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have any assets in Canada, it’s hard for Canada to do anything to you. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If this were in the U.S., it would be a question of fair use. You could make a good case for it.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The OTW exists in part to help with cases like that in the U.S. That said, nothing has happened so far.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some institutions have blanket licenses to play music. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Showing vids in museum exhibitions has actually helped bolster arguments that vids are clear fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What I heard was that Canadian rules applied over U.S. rules, the risk was low, and if something were to happen, I would have some help. I decided to accept. As I said to Francesca: It’s about time I put my money where my mouth is in terms of standing up for the rights of fan creators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So I decided &lt;a href=&quot;#crisis&quot;&gt;which name to use&lt;/a&gt;, signed the contract, later cashed the check—which wasn’t a gigantic amount but basically covered my hotel stay when the exhibit opened; &lt;a href=&quot;#opening&quot;&gt;more on that&lt;/a&gt; in a minute-—and never faced a copyright challenge. In fact, the worst that happened is that now, one year later, I have to properly figure it into my taxes: “income from activities not engaged in for profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#crisis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Identity Crisis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;crisis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;identity-crisis&quot;&gt;Identity Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After easing my &lt;a href=&quot;#legal&quot;&gt;worries about litigation&lt;/a&gt;, the question remained of which name to use in the gallery materials and on the curator’s card that would hang next to the vid monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I mean, “bironic” was the obvious choice, right? It’s the name on the vid and my name in fandom. But going that route meant closing some doors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It meant limiting the people I felt comfortable talking to about the exhibit. I couldn’t post about it on Facebook because that would break down the wall between my real-life and fannish identities that I’ve worked so hard over the last 10-plus years to reinforce. I couldn’t talk about it openly at work because people would ask to see the vid and then they would know my pseudonym and two enterprising clicks later could read my porn and public journal entries. (I prefer those entries to remain public for several reasons, even when they’re about intimate topics, but my comfort level is linked to remaining anonymous. The age-old dilemma.) Similarly, it’s not something I can put on my résumé without bracing for questions that invite awkward, evasive answers. No excited sharing of the initial news; no pictures when I took the trip to Vancouver. There’s only a small Venn diagram of people to whom I can show that photo above, unedited.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It meant losing an opportunity for minor “fame” by not having my real name in gallery materials. I admit it did give me a pang when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_mashup1.html&quot;&gt;exhibit website&lt;/a&gt; went &lt;a href=&quot;#real&quot;&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;promo materials&lt;/a&gt; started coming out and I saw all these World-Famous Artists’ names and thought, &lt;em&gt;My name could have been there among them&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, bironic is my name, in a way, but it’s not quite the same. Nor is it the name most people in my offline life would recognize. If an old friend or teacher came across those museum ads in the wild, they wouldn’t email me in excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So, you know, ego stuff. And some other repercussions, some of them amusing. I had to take care when filling out the paperwork, signing the contract with my fannish name, filling out a supplemental form with my legal name, address, etc., and adding a hand-written note reminding the curators and whomever to please keep the two identities separate. (Francesca had already talked to them about that for all of us, and that’s why she initially acted as intermediary. She also offered to mediate if any of the vidders wanted to, for example, accept the fee but not share their RL info.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A sort of funny consequence was that half a year later when the curators sent out invitations to attend the exhibit opening, I RSVP’d with my real name (I think?) and someone didn’t make the connection, so they didn’t realize I was coming until &lt;a href=&quot;#opening&quot;&gt;I showed up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other funny thing was that one of the curatorial assistants inadvertently confirmed that my ongoing attempts to keep RL and fannish identities distinct were working, because she sent this note after trying to, I assume, find out by Googling “bironic”:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;For the exhibition labels, it is our house standard to include year and place of birth next to the artist's name but I haven't been able to find this information for you online. Could you please send me this information at your earliest convenience? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(I didn’t realize it was for the card on the wall, so I was vague and said “New York,” and that is the exciting story of how my birthplace was cited… not quite accurately.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Whenever any of these downsides presented themselves, though, I took comfort in the fact that everyone else in the vidding exhibit went with their fannish names. And I was still able to share the thrill of the experience with people in my life who matter a lot to me: my family, my RL friends who know about this hobby, and all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I always say yes, on principle, in that in my view I’ve already released the vid onto the internet - it’s out there, you know? I put it out there! On Youtube and so on - No sense in denying it! :P A lot of people don’t ask anyway - just go ahead and show the vid, which I approve of because it’s no hassle to me then. And sometimes I discover they have, and that’s a nice surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;[…] I don’t actively take on the agenda of whoever is showing a vid. The show is theirs and the vid is just material for it. I don’t feel like it flows upstream to me. I don’t really think any of it has much to do with me. I am really concerned with the making of vids, not the watching of them. (I’m not a good vid watcher!) And I don’t really spend much time thinking/imagining other people watching my vids, either. I know they do, from time to time, and when they write posts or recs (or anti-recs) I often read those with great interest. But I’m really interested, there, in how the vid bounces off that other person. What they bring to the table. That’s the part that’s interesting to me, not so much, hm, I’m not using the audience as a mirror, if that makes sense. It doesn’t work for me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The very first time a vid of mine was exhibited outside fandom - for Mediated at the California Museum of Photography in like 2008 - I had a very different response, I think. I found it quite brutal. I was much newer to vidding and I am quite shy anyway and found the attention uncomfortable - it was a vid I had made in only my first year of vidding and it was a bit overwhelming and complicated to navigate. But I am old now and don’t care, hahah. […]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Anyway, [Mediated] was uncomfortable in some ways but the discomfort was quite generative: at that time I thought a lot about how I would show vids, if I were to show them, and maybe I’ll do that someday actually - put on a show that’s ALL vids and sensible of the particular aesthetics of vidding. We should do that some day. It would be fun. It’s percolating.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Months after signing the contracts, sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop—because how could something this cool really happen, or happen without complications—it finally felt real. Somehow I had created something that someone thought worth including in this exhibit. Somehow Francesa considered “Starships!” on a level with works by Kandy Fong and obsessive24 and here’s luck and Lim and Shadow Songs, at least in a collection themed around the progression of mashups. WTF, right? &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(I wasn’t the &lt;a href=&quot;heresluck.dreamwidth.org/1056687.html&quot;&gt;only one excited&lt;/a&gt;, either, which helped me feel less silly!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And then, even more good news: Even though the gallery itself was not able to provide travel funds to participants, between the artist’s fee and an unexpected holiday gift from my mom I was suddenly in a position to fly to Vancouver and see the exhibit in person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There was some conferring amongst the vidders and Ces about arranging to meet there, on opening night or some other weekend before our part of the exhibit closed that June, but schedules and finances and logistics and other matters got in the way. I made an executive decision to RSVP for myself, at least, before fares rose too high, and I’m so glad I did, since no one else was able to make it, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Francesca first emailed us to ask us to contribute, I was thrilled and delighted and said yes immediately. I know at least one of the other vidders was more anxious, for legal reasons, but given the OTW’s recent work to secure DMCA exemptions for vidders and other fannish remixers, which has done a lot to establish vidding as a fair rather than infringing use of copyrighted material, I wasn’t at all concerned about that. And the fact that we were being approached about showing vids in an art exhibit felt really momentous to me. Over the last ten years, vidding has been getting increased attention in fan studies circles and even to some extent media studies more generally, but quite a bit of that attention has been focused more on vids as evidence of audience activity than on vids as art. So to be included in a major exhibit that puts vids not in a fannish context but in the context of 20th and 21st century art – and in a subcollection curated by Francesca, who’s done more than anyone to make the argument that vids are art and ought to be understood as art – was really, really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It was so exciting that in some ways it didn’t even feel real, at first! But then as we began to get details about the exhibit, it did start to feel real – and overwhelming! Having my name, our names, on the list of exhibitors along with names like Pablo Picasso, T.S. Eliot, Barbara Kruger, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Byrne, Danger Mouse, Girl Talk, DJ Spooky – it’s not just that these are big names, but that they’re artists whose work I know and admire! Actually, for me, the most head-spinning co-exhibitor was Negativland: I loved Negativland in college, saw them play live on campus, wore the concert t-shirt all the time, wore out my tapes of Escape From Noise and Helter Stupid… Their music was probably my first exposure to multimedia remix and certainly their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland#U2_record_incident&quot;&gt;legal wrangle with Island Records&lt;/a&gt; over the U2 EP (“I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” now with kazoos!) was my first encounter with debates over transformative re-use of copyrighted and trademarked material.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But in some ways the most amazing and overwhelming part was being included with these amazing vidders. I originally got into vidding in the early 2000s without any sense of its history; vidding was important to me personally and creatively – it became my main creative outlet, it’s how I met a lot of the people I was (and am) closest to in fandom. But as I learned more about the history of vidding and our fannish foremothers, and as I started to get a better sense of all the different vidding traditions and aesthetics and styles and approaches that are out there, I started to feel like I was connected to something much bigger than just my little group of vid-loving fannish friends. There are so many of us doing so many amazing different things! So to have my work tapped to help represent vids and vidders and vidding is an immense honor. And to be in company with people like Kandy Fong, who invented vidding, and Lim, whose work blows my mind, and Obsessive24, whom I admire so much and have learned so much from, and [bironic] and Shadow Songs, who’ve made these vids that I just adore… it’s mind-blowing, in the best possible way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;opening&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;opening-night&quot;&gt;Opening Night&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At last, February 19 in Vancouver: mountains and maritime air, unbelievable sushi, fringe theater, and the “VIP” reception the night before the MashUp exhibit opened to the public. I was sad and a bit nervous to be the only vidder there amongst strangers with their arty outfits and/or deep pockets. Let us not discuss how long it took to figure out what to wear. But it turned out fine!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While everyone was still corralled in the entry room, I found a random staffer and asked if any of the curators were there. She introduced me to one of the three, Daina, who brought over the assistant curator, Stephanie, who was more closely involved in our section and who was a joy to talk to. Later they grabbed my elbow as I was passing by and introduced me to the last curator, Bruce. They all seemed happy to have me there and wanted to talk about Francesca, our section curator, and whether any of the other vidders would be coming at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Daina made me talk to a New York art dealer in a scarf, which really completed the gallery-opening experience, even if he preferred the tactile nature of mid-century collage and did not have much interest in digital work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/clapping.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Something unexpected happened during the opening speeches: Among other things, Bruce named the half dozen artists or so who had come to the opening and included me at the end! People seemed familiar with the names that had come before—UJINO, Liz Magor, I forget who else—based on applause, so maybe that’s why he prefaced mine with “And somebody you probably don’t know, but should…” (!!) Only he then said, at least to my anxious ears, “bee&lt;em&gt;mumble&lt;/em&gt;,” so I guess I lost my chance at fame. Anyway, I raised my hand and people clapped politely, and it all felt very surreal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After the speeches, they let us loose on the exhibit, which spanned the entirety of the four-floor building. Naturally, I ran up to snap some pictures of &lt;a href=&quot;#wall&quot;&gt;our section&lt;/a&gt; first. Then I &lt;a href=&quot;#impressions&quot;&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; the top floors and came back to the vidding hall when actual people were there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#impressions&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Impressions of the MashUp exhibit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Describing the experience of walking through this giant multimedia exhibition on the history of 20th-21st century mashups felt daunting until I realized I don’t actually have to write an essay on that history and the place of vidding within it, nor an analysis of the objects the curators chose for inclusion and the way they organized the collection, because the gallery website and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.vanartgallery.bc.ca/collections/publications/products/mashup-the-birth-of-modern-culture&quot;&gt;350-page exhibit guide&lt;/a&gt; already took care of that, as did various articles online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(If you click on the tabs for each floor at that gallery link, there’s even more in-depth text.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Suffice to say that it was satisfying to see the curators acknowledge fan vidding as a notable form of remixing with artistic merit worthy of being placed alongside household names like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Brian Eno. Fanfiction and especially the annual Remix Redux would have had a home as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Starting on the fourth floor and working down provided a more or less chronological tour through the many ways people have appropriated existing media materials and subverted, built on or otherwise transformed them into something new and wonderful. I nodded at familiar examples of fan practice’s cousins (e.g. Jamaican dub, William S. Burroughs’ cut-ups, T.S. Eliot’s dense intertextuality, Quentin Tarantino’s metacommentary on film history) and ancestors (e.g. Victorian photo collage, by women, fittingly*) and learned a lot about other fascinating members of the family tree both close and distant. I was particularly entranced by a sound poem written and recited by Kurt Schwitters presented alongside a song version composed by Brian Eno, Kurt’s Rejoinder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Little change through time of the kinds of critique, censorship, copyright battles and celebration that their—our—works have engendered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;mid copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d been worried about how male-centric the exhibit would be, based on promo materials and early exhibit descriptions, so I was glad to see that it paid homage to the critical contributions of women from the very beginning. The introductory curator’s card on the top floor began with Georges Braque and Picasso, but then in the second paragraph, there were the women collage-makers. Cuttin’ up ur magazines, shakin’ up ur art. &lt;q&gt;These collages were often enclosed in personal albums, made more for the amusement of small social circles than for wider public exhibition and appreciation&lt;/q&gt; —sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While gender wasn’t balanced overall, many women were nevertheless featured on each floor. More on that from &lt;a href=&quot;www.straight.com/arts/643691/mashup-reveals-pivotal-role-women-pioneering-modern-art-methods&quot;&gt;straight.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Heavy on Western work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wall&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEXT: Vids Onna Wall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;parallax viewport&quot; id=&quot;brick&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vids Onna Wall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;wall&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vidding subcollection was situated in a darkened corner on the third floor of the exhibit, past Warhol’s Marilyns and clips from Jean-Luc Godard films, and adjacent to a Jamaican dub sound studio, which I thought was perfect, thematically. Related sections on hip hop and on the Black and Latino LGBT community drag balls in NYC depicted in magazines and the movie Paris Is Burning were on the next floor down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/floorplan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The layout of the vidding section was unfortunate in that four of the seven vid monitors were in a narrow hallway, so people had to either stand close to the screen if they wanted to put on the single pair of headphones mounted beneath each so others could pass through behind them, or else stand against the opposite wall and watch without sound. I saw visitors doing both.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other three vids, though, which were the earliest, Kandy Fong’s and Shadow Songs’, were in the larger vestibule-type corner where it was easier to congregate and linger. That’s also where the curatorial text on vidding as a whole was located.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure--&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if this part of the exhibit was always so dim, allowing, I imagine, the vids themselves to look vibrant, or if it was lit that way only for the opening reception. A few people did lean forward to squint at the curators’ cards. Anyway, that’s why the pictures are kind of crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I haunted the vidding area for probably 45-60 minutes on and off over the course of the evening to see how people behaved when they came over. Reactions seemed to run the gamut: Some kept walking, some glanced at a screen or two and continued on, some read the vidding description with interest, some watched whole or parts of vids without audio, some put on the headphones and did the same, some shared or tried to share the headphones with whomever they were with (some partners accepted and others refused), a few went from screen to screen and watched at least part of each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I wish we as a community could have stationed someone besides the docent in the room with a button that said “Ask me about vidding!” or something. For example, to explain how to do it “right.” But then, in the midst of an exhibit about remix, appropriation and subverting authorial intentions, who’s to say what “right” is?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;card&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This vid—shared prolifically through tens of thousands of online viewings—has benefited from the increased accessibility of the internet since the inception of vidding in the 1970s, and also draws on the history of the medium, establishing links to earlier vids such as “Data’s Dream” (1993), which also takes viewers on a journey through fantastical worlds. Both play to our emotions through strategic connections between imagery and aspects of the selected song.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The meticulous attention given to the details of the accompanying music—genre, song choice, tone, lyrics, musicality—is vital to the effectiveness of such popular vids in connecting with their viewers. The synchronicity of the recognizable and emotion-filled clips of starships paired with Nicki Minaj’s song “Starships” essentially produces an intense emotional response that directs the viewer not only to think about spaceships but to consider how we feel about spaceships and space travel.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;mid copy&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A friend asked later what I thought about the text on the “Starships!” placard. (“Were you, for example, consciously referencing ‘Data’s Dream’?”) I found myself approaching the description from a dispassionate perspective—after flailing over seeing it right there on the wall like a Real Artist exhibiting a Notable Work, that is—interested in how Ces had decided to frame the vid within the theme and chronological progression she was working to establish for this mini collection. I hadn’t thought of “Data’s Dream” as a work “Starships!” was responding to, but “Starships!” wouldn’t exist without the tradition of multifandom vids that came before it, and “Data’s Dream” is at the root of that tradition. Ces did a good job of tracing lineages, demonstrating evolution and making other connections among the vids she chose to represent vidding as mashup technique, and I think this one was on point. The second half of the description I think was important for explaining to visitors some of the basics of what vidders try to do, because based on the behavior of some of the people I saw, it wasn’t always intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If I had had the opportunity to change anything about the text, besides swapping “synchronicity” for the oft-confused “synchrony,” I would have asked for it to say “hundreds of thousands of views” instead of “tens”—not even to brag, but to have had a slightly more impressive number to show to people unfamiliar with vidding who might have thought it’s a thing that, like, five people do. Not that “Starships!” is anywhere near the top of vid view counts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/mashup/queue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see, but there are a lot of people on that sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After about three hours, when I couldn’t stand up any longer and had to go, more than 500 people had attended the event—and the line to get in still went down the block. There were so many attendees still pouring in, in fact, that I couldn’t even see all the installations on the ground floor because it was too crowded for me. Well, I had “museum brain” by that point as well. There were so many interesting things to see and watch and listen to and interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Back in 1974, I was part of the group that founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_United_Federation_of_Phoenix&quot;&gt;The United Federation of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, the longest running Star Trek club in the world. I met John Fong at the first meeting. He’d purchased some of the unused pieces of film left over after Gene Roddenberry edited the classic Star Trek episodes. I had the idea of using those unique pictures to create new ST stories. The first one used those pieces mounted as slides set to an audio-tape recording of a short story I’d written, plus a filk song, “What Do You Do With A Drunken Vulcan.” Due to the enthusiastic response of fans, and the active support of Gene Roddenberry, who not only gave me permission, but gave me more slides to use, I created hours of stories to show to fans.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Fast forward years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vividcon&quot;&gt;Vividcon&lt;/a&gt;, the vidders’ convention. They honored me as the mother of the fannish music video. I responded by contacting the earliest vidders, and with their help, created a two-part retrospective about the beginning of vidding. I thought that this would be of interest only to the fans who made videos. Then, I met Francesca Coppa, and found out about Fanlore and the fannish history project.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To my great surprise, other main-stream historians and academics became interested in our video history as part of popular culture. Universities started archiving our creations. Starting in 2013, Museums like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2013/06/29/detail/cut-up/&quot;&gt;Museum of the Moving Image&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, and the Vancouver Artgallery in Canada started featuring shows about Cut Ups and Mash-ups and included some of my music videos.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When I talk about my inclusion in these exhibits, I can’t help smiling or even chuckling. It is almost unbelievable to me, that something that I started doing so long ago as entertainment for fans, is now considered important enough to be in a museum show with work from artists like Andy Warhol and Picasso. I am so tickled, and feel deeply honored. Wow!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So that is the story of how a vid that I rushed to put together in two weeks for Club Vivid in 2012 ended up in a museum show that I will half-disbelievingly boast about forever to… a small group of people who can know my fan identity and haven’t already heard the story. And also random strangers, such as Vancouver bus drivers and fellow hotel guests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What hindsight now, to recall the sudden void after rushing to get the vid done, having to wait from April to August to see how it went over at Vividcon, being afraid that someone else would make the same vid in the intervening months because the song was all over the charts and the choice of clips was not exactly subtle. Then, this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although it would have been better to have had friends along, I’m glad I was able to see it in person and share some of what the experience was like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a real boost in confidence and pride, both in my own vidding ability and in this corner of the external art world’s acknowledgement of the significance of our whole endeavor. I have also been deeply gratified to see little crumbs of evidence in the past year that our vids made an impression on a few visitors, at least some of whom were being introduced to vidding for the first time:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Absolutely loved so much stuff at the MASHUP show at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VanArtGallery&quot;&gt;@VanArtGallery&lt;/a&gt; but my favourite? “Starships” vid by Bironic &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/T7NL538ZkK&quot;&gt;https://t.co/T7NL538ZkK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Johnny (@bluefacedbeast) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bluefacedbeast/status/731652090724896768&quot;&gt;15 May 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not something of mine is ever included again, I look forward to seeing how vids and other fanworks continue to evolve in the public consciousness through exhibits like this one. One day we’ll move beyond those irritating thinkpieces that laugh at what fans do and be able to share with more of the world the true joy and value of vids and fic and podfic and fanart and crafts etc. etc.: as labors of love, as critique, as celebration, as community-building, as art.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Lyrical interpretation is not something new. Vidders have been doing it for years, but we aim to make the process a bit more transparent and outline it more fully for those who wish to analyze clip choices and narratives more closely, then apply it to their own vidding.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Dissecting lyrical interpretation is making the brushstrokes visible. Picasso did not paint the world as he saw it. He painted it as he processed it in the same way that vidders do. Vidding is a lie that makes people see the truth. When working through a lyrical interpretation of a vidsong, aim to make choices that strengthens that truth you are trying to vid and let that drive the lyrical interpretations.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/lyrical/picasso-bull.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sol-se.livejournal.com/777395.html&quot;&gt;Black Dresses&lt;/a&gt; - The inclusion of the Black Dresses clip shows that you can use the simplest lyrical interpretation in a non-humorous manner and it will still work.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
				&lt;/dl&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li title=&quot;a to b before a&quot;&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h3 id=&quot;a2bba&quot;&gt;A to B before A&lt;/h3&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Literal interpretation before the lyric. Gives an &quot;aha&quot; discovery when it is still literal with the restructure giving cleverness.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;dl class=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kuwdora.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;kuwdora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sync-slaying.livejournal.com/35950.html&quot;&gt;Run Boy Run&lt;/a&gt; - The literal use of Catelyn &quot;disappearing&quot; into the trees to hide her emotion from the soldiers is elevated emotionally when later the same soldiers murder and hang prostitutes from the branches of those trees.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
				&lt;/dl&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li title=&quot;a to literal b&quot;&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h3 id=&quot;a2lb&quot;&gt;A to literal B out of music context&lt;/h3&gt;
				&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The words of the song literally mean something different than how the song is using them in context with the visual source using the literal interpretation, typically love songs with violent visual source.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;dl class=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;jescaflowne&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elefantpaw.com/vids-2&quot;&gt;Jar Oh! Hearts&lt;/a&gt;

						&lt;a href=&quot;http://elipie.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;elipie&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jumpercut.livejournal.com/10569.html&quot;&gt;Applause&lt;/a&gt; - Within the song, the lyrics &quot;put your hands up / make 'em touch&quot; mean clapping/applause, while parts of the vid take it literally with a fist bump between two friends.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;
						&lt;a href=&quot;http://cherryice.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;cherryice&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cherryice.livejournal.com/280731.html&quot;&gt;(You Drive Me) Crazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://frayadjacent.dreamwidth.org/36047.html&quot;&gt;Tightrope&lt;/a&gt; - Within the song &quot;elevated&quot; means elevated social status, while this clip takes it literally with Buffy pulling herself higher on a building with a negative onlooker.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beccatoria.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;beccatoria&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beccatoria.dreamwidth.org/129498.html&quot;&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;Food for thought&quot; typically means having a deep convo, but here it is used as Olivia Dunham's favorite sustenance: whiskey.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bironic.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;bironic&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bironic.livejournal.com/244379.html&quot;&gt;They Want More&lt;/a&gt; - This extended clip is from the dinosaur's point of view with unexpected literal interpretations.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;grable242&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/pZ9ASjxGj6A&quot;&gt;Radioactive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sol-se.livejournal.com/777395.html&quot;&gt;Black Dresses&lt;/a&gt; - The focus of the vid is the leader of a family based criminal organization. Her sons mess up a lot and she punishes them harshly, either despite or because they are her sons.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;
						&lt;a href=&quot;http://isagel.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;isagel&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://isagel.dreamwidth.org/308577.html&quot;&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; - The &quot;go home&quot; as in you are dead and &quot;arrival&quot; as the birth of the character, Root.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://anoel.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;anoel&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://anoel.livejournal.com/151380.html&quot;&gt;Past the Feeling&lt;/a&gt; - Most simply without context, the key is the apple.&lt;/dd&gt;
						
						&lt;dt&gt;Cara Marie&lt;/dt&gt;
						&lt;dd&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://genusshrike.dreamwidth.org/293025.html&quot;&gt;If A Machine&lt;/a&gt; - Human emotions coming out of robots in situations.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sdwolfpup.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;sdwolfpup&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sdwolfpup.livejournal.com/187754.html&quot;&gt;Woman King&lt;/a&gt; - Alma is the woman king, Bullock is the sword, and Alma's father is the evil.
					&lt;dt&gt;nc's &lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pb.talkoncorners.net/taxonomy/term/3&quot;&gt;Beautiful Struggle&lt;/a&gt; - It starts with Harry being pushed and his name in the goblet against his will, then shows a comparison of Cedrick embracing wizard celebrity to Harry not accepting it.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://giandujakiss.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;giandujakiss&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://giandujakiss.livejournal.com/360051.html&quot;&gt;Origin Stories&lt;/a&gt; - This clip has multiple A to C lyrical interpretations including the &quot;memories of you,&quot; which could be taken as A to B without the source knowledge for the outside world and memories of you being Dana having the memories of previous slayers in her head.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lithiumdoll.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;lithiumdoll&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vidukon.livejournal.com/17010.html&quot;&gt;Sea Lion&lt;/a&gt; - Example of characters cast as objects with Sam as the stone and John as the chisel with Dean in the middle with the point of view.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hollywoodgrrl.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;hollywoodgrrl&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.livejournal.com/sync_slaying/19750.html&quot;&gt;Marble House&lt;/a&gt; - Martha does so many things &quot;for free&quot; for the Doctor that she becomes like his own personal straw soldier; to be sent out and discarded at his whim.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obsessive24.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;obsessive24&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obsessive24.livejournal.com/364171.html&quot;&gt;Follow the Cops Back Home&lt;/a&gt; - The lyrics speak of following the police home and robbing them. In the context of the vid, Altlivia crosses universes with our guys and, pretending to be Olivia, &quot;robs&quot; her house by having sex with Peter.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ohvienna.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;ohvienna&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sync-slaying.livejournal.com/24486.html&quot;&gt;At My House(s)&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;Can't get in the door&quot; is used on Nicki taking birth control, and followed by an A to B interpretation of Alby breaking into the house via awkward window climbing.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
				&lt;/dl&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li title=&quot;a as evolution&quot;&gt;

			&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h3 id=&quot;aae&quot;&gt;A as Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Same lyric taking on different interpretations as the vid progresses. jarrow refers to these as the &quot;vids that betray your trust.&quot; They start out with one lyrical interpretation that evolves down a different path than the tone of the beginning suggested.
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jarrow.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;jarrow&lt;/a&gt; refers to these as the &quot;vids that betray your trust.&quot; They start out with one lyrical interpretation that evolves down a different path than the tone of the beginning suggested.
					&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;dl class=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sweetestdrain.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;sweetestdrain&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sweetestdrain.livejournal.com/268519.html&quot;&gt;Hot in Herre&lt;/a&gt; - We could include many of this vidder's vids, but this one I specifically used because of how the evolution of the vid is hinted at and builds with &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; left along the way.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obsessive24.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;obsessive24&lt;/a&gt;
					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://obsessive24.livejournal.com/491408.html&quot;&gt;Young and Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; - Along with an evolution in the point of view, the lyrical interpretation also evolves into a larger scaled scheme.
					&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dt&gt;Nicole Anell&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nicole-anell.livejournal.com/84062.html&quot;&gt;Jolene&lt;/a&gt; - Jolene is first introduced as the woman that's taking Callie's man away from her in terms of a relationship, just as the song intended. But then the vid evolves and Jolene becomes the Cylons and then specifically the Final Four as they realize they are Cylons themselves.
					&lt;/dd&gt;

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sync-slaying.livejournal.com/35044.html&quot;&gt;Stayin' Low!&lt;/a&gt; - The first chorus demonstrates Ripley's resolve to actively stay alive, while the second chorus shows the cost of that. Not only does she battle PTSD, but slowly, which each film she loses more and more of her humanity, until she is actually part alien herself.
					&lt;/dd&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;When context is needed from the source that a casual viewer would not glean from the source or that is forgotten or that requires the same reading of the source as the vidder. It can be done well, but there is always the case of going too far. Mostly it is being too in your own head for others to go with you and sometimes explaining it does not make them want to go down the rabbit hole with you.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://laurashapiro.livejournal.com/338287.html&quot;&gt;Everything is Wrong&lt;/a&gt; - An inside joke done well of Britta mispronouncing bagels as &quot;baggles&quot; because she lived in New York and would know.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kiki-miserychic.livejournal.com/210338.html&quot;&gt;Black Dove (January)&lt;/a&gt; - This takes woods and goes a few too many steps from woods to woods are made of trees and trees are used to make paper and paper is used to make books and books are kept in a library, then the viewer has to remember that city in the clip is a giant library.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sync-slaying.livejournal.com/35950.html&quot;&gt;Run Boy Run&lt;/a&gt; - Jaqen H'ghar has a habit of referring to himself as &quot;man&quot; in an odd third-person speech pattern sort of way. He is also a master assassin and Arya is going to be one soon. All things you need to know from book source/show watching.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sync-slaying.livejournal.com/24486.html&quot;&gt;At My House(s)&lt;/a&gt; - Fundamental Mormonism requires lots and lots of babies, which the vidder expressed very well with the &quot;more cowbell&quot; lyrics. However you have to know that not all the wives are into having more babies (as witnessed in a clip earlier with Nicki taking birth control so no swimmers can get into her door).

On another level, when the clip of the flags hits, its suddenly the &lt;i&gt;countries&lt;/i&gt; asking these people to love them and fight for them. The love of country is the deepest love for these people.

It's the people who are born and bred this way, a product of the environment which is strife with one industry, that industry being the production of meth.

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://anoel.livejournal.com/151380.html&quot;&gt;Past the Feeling&lt;/a&gt; - If the POV is Regina, who is her daughter and who is her son?

					&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thuviaptarth.dreamwidth.org/274968.html&quot;&gt;Hey Ho&lt;/a&gt; - It starts with Tony Stark as a kid being indoctrinated into the war to him serving the military industrial complex, even as Iron Man, along with Steve's Captain America buying in. The merchant kings is Stark Industries, but then it evolves into Marvel Comics itself with the children being indoctrinated by Tony Stark's Iron Man through marketing.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bironic.livejournal.com/290856.html&quot;&gt;Masters of War (Pegasus Rising Remix)&lt;/a&gt; - Continuing with Masters of War and X is Y, if bombs are bombs seen through Pegasus citizens, then the walls are shield technologies. &quot;you play with my world&quot; is A to B with John and Rodney playing a game that actually controls an entire planet, which works on more levels than is contained in an A to B lyrical interpretation. If all of that is true, then the mansion is Atlantis and they watch people die from the safety of a shield.

					&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://giandujakiss.dreamwidth.org/78262.html&quot;&gt;A Charming Man&lt;/a&gt; - The lyrics in &quot;A Charming Man&quot; can be interpreted to be a group of criminals with the brains of the operation &quot;cracking calculus,&quot; the cleaner that comes in to be the muscle, and the POV of &quot;me&quot; as the charming con man that sweet talks the cons. That framework is laid over the characters with the father being God.

				&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;In music everyone plays the same note. It's the same way everyone has the same lyrics of a song for vidding. For music it is all in how you play the note. For vidding it is how you interpret the lyrics. Eric Clapton playing an E is different from Santana playing an E is different from Karen O playing an E. It is how you tune your instrument to interpret the lyrics to make your sound.
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;There are songs used multiple times in vids partly because they have lyrics that can be interpreted to fit storyline tropes, like Seamstress.

					&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
					&lt;h5&gt;Blinding&lt;/h5&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;For instance Blinding can be used for a character that was purposely not told a secret, like Abigail in Hannibal, Morgana in Merlin, and even Lydia in Teen Wolf. The lyrics overlay completely with both characters in these vids with varied interpretations, like &quot;kiss,&quot; &quot;gentle word,&quot; &quot;slumber&quot; and the &quot;you&quot; being those who denied them the truth.

					&lt;p&gt;Matches to Paper Dolls is a very popular choice for couples. The interpretations for the first set of lyrics are varied, yet they have commonalities. The lyrics themselves do not use &quot;door,&quot; yet it is implied with locks and keys and it is interesting to see the interpretations of keys being A to B with a physical key, A to C in the form of gifts and mind control, A to opposite A with someone breaking in without a key.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Symbolism transforms the experience into an idea and an idea into an image, so that the idea expressed through the image remains always active and unattainable and, even though expressed in all languages, remains inexpressible.

						&lt;p&gt;~Goethe&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/blockquote&gt;
				&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Metaphors and symbolism populate poetry and lyrics. If Juliet is the sun, it tells us a lot about Juliet because it gives us all the analogies that come with the sun. We recognize patterns and overlay them with the literal meaning. Goethe said &quot;Symbolism transforms the experience into an idea and an idea into an image, so that the idea expressed through the image remains always active and unattainable and, even though expressed in all languages, remains inexpressible.&quot;

					&lt;p&gt;I think of lyrical interpretation as reverse engineering. You do not have to start at the beginning. You can start with the lyrics that prompted you to make the vid and work your way out to make a web connected with metaphor and symbolism.
					&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A History of Vidding</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;splash&quot; id=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidding is communal poetry. It weaves together familiar images and beloved characters with music to create an intimate emotional journey. Fanvids bypass our higher cognitive functions and aim straight for our limbic center: where we laugh, where we sing and where we cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;fan-vidding-in-the-beginning&quot;&gt;Fan Vidding… In the beginning…&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vidding&quot;&gt;Fan vidding&lt;/a&gt; draws some of its origins from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music&quot;&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt; which itself utilizes pre-existing and well-loved stories and myths and resets them to music. Until the invention of the moving picture, these re-imaginings remained aural, not visual.  What makes fan vidding unique is the 20th century technology. This allowed ordinary consumers access both to the visual media (TV and media) as well as the audio and the ability to edit and reshape those sources.  The introduction of that new and more accessible technology inspired multiple communities across the world to interact with moving images and sound in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Discover what the Beatles’ “Strawberry Fields” has to do with the birth of modern media vidding?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hear how one fan’s “dowry” consisted of three boxes of Star Trek film clips.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What DO you do with a drunken Vulcan?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Be amazed that a vidding fan in 1980 would have had to shell out (in today’s US dollars) nearly $6000 to simply begin.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shiver at the terribleness of 5th and 6th gen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Behold the power of the stopwatch.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Enjoy the antics of two 1977 role-playing Betamax salesmen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on the challenges of rainbow noise, flying erase heads, jog shuttles, and dirty frames.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Curse when a major vidding collective was driven even further underground by the actions of a well known professionally run convention.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Boo and hiss at the word “Macrovision.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Also: the costs and challenges to early vidders,  how technology shaped the storytelling, the power of feedback, language, and vocabulary, learning to structure a vidshow, thwarting the powers that be, and most importantly, the indispensability of mentors and community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animemusicvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=44607&quot; id=&quot;amv-tip&quot;&gt;robust vidding histories&lt;/a&gt; in anime and gaming fandoms, my “History of Vidding” focuses on a small slice of time and space: the community of women who were fans of TV and movies popular in the Western world and their contributions to vidding in the 1970s through the 1990s. As with most “history of” essays, it is prone to subjective memory, information available, and personal perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;aside id=&quot;amv&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“1983 is about the time that the first AMV(s) started to emerge… Most of them were done back then by people who had access to video editing suites and two VHS decks since owning 2 VCRs back then was a luxury that only a few could afford…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, in around the late 80s, two VCRs were getting common and so “Home” made AMVs started to appear… The trick back then was to try to make your edits without the “Rainbows” since Flying erase head VCRs back then costed you about $1200 US. I kid you not since my first 4 head Hi-Fi VCR cost me that much!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Back then as well, AMVs were a cult of a small group of people and AMV contests were shown in rooms the size of shoe boxes. Most people laughed at us and figured it was a novelty and would wear out. Boy were they wrong! …&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;….What do I remember of editing on two VCRs… Hmmmm sore back from bending over the two units… having to listed to the songs 1,000,000 times over a weekend since after 1 or two edits you needed to review things before going on.. Walking 30 miles to the only anime VHS bootleg rental place to get sources”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A long time ago, in a galaxy not that far away...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The creation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vid&quot;&gt;fanvids&lt;/a&gt; required two things: access to consumer-level audio-visual equipment and the average fan’s ability to obtain TV/movie video source. Commercial “music videos” or the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_short&quot;&gt;musical short&lt;/a&gt;” dates back to the 1920s, but popular musical artists began offering musical short in the late 1950s and early 1960s to help sell their music. It was the Beatles who, in 1967 took the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video#1960.E2.80.931973:_Promotional_clips_and_others&quot;&gt;promotional videos&lt;/a&gt; to a new artistic height.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The colour promotional clips for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever#Music_video&quot;&gt;Strawberry Fields Forever&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Lane&quot;&gt;Penny Lane&lt;/a&gt;”, made in early 1967 and directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Goldman&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;Peter Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, took the promotional film format to a new level. They used techniques borrowed from underground and avant garde film, including reversed film and slow motion, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles and color filtering added in post-production.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video#1960.E2.80.931973:_Promotional_clips_and_others&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

        &lt;p&gt;Kodak slide carousel: The slides, 35 mm film clips encased in a cardboard sleeve, are projected against a darkened wall or screen. Early slide projectors were manually operated, but later ones could be programmed to advance slides at a regular pace. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel_slide_projector&quot;&gt;They became popular in the mid-1960s. &lt;/a&gt; Slide projectors were discontinued in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Kandy_Fong&quot;&gt;Kandy Fong&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Star_Trek&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; fan based in Phoenix, Arizona watched “Strawberry Fields Forever” and realized she could use do something similar for her favorite TV show. Her soon-to-be husband had access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Film_clips&quot;&gt;film clips&lt;/a&gt; from Star Trek TV episodes. These were actual clips of 35mm film that had been left on the Desilu Studios editing room floor during production of the series in the 1960s. These film clips were then mounted into slides and sold to collectors. In addition, Kandy had a slide projector carousel and a cassette tape player. She now had music, video, and source, the three main ingredients to making a fanvid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During a 2012 interview with her long-time friend Marnie, Kandy explained:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kandy Fong: The Beatles did a music video for “Strawberry Fields.” Where they were doing things like jumping out of trees, and then this long piano, that went up— the strings went up into the tree, and they were doing all sorts of things. They weren’t standing there and playing instruments, which was all the music videos you’d seen to date. And I thought, duh. This guy I’m dating has the cigar boxes full of little pieces of film from Star Trek. I’ll betcha I could put those together and tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Marnie: Off-cuts, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;KF: And, because the local Star Trek club in Phoenix, which is the longest-running fan club in the world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Phoenix&quot;&gt;United Federation of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; — thank you, I named it— (laughter)  Umm— needed entertainment. I figured, well, let’s put together a little show. So I said, “Hey. Hey, best friend. Hey, hey, future husband— (laughter) —let’s get this idea, and put together a show.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;MS: [He] had no idea what he was getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;KF: I know. That was his dowry. The three cigar boxes full (of Star Trek film clips).&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/fcoppa/clips/what-do-you-do-with-a-drunken-vulcan&quot;&gt;recreated version of the slideshow&lt;/a&gt; can be viewed on Critical Commons. Kandy and her friends recorded themselves singing a capella onto a cassette tape for the music.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the first live-action fanvids was a short comedy about the character of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Spock_(TOS)&quot;&gt;Mr. Spock&lt;/a&gt; set to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Filk&quot;&gt;filk&lt;/a&gt; song “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/What_Do_You_Do_With_a_Drunken_Vulcan%3F&quot;&gt;What Do You Do With a Drunken Vulcan?&lt;/a&gt;” It was shown in 1975 at a meeting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_United_Federation_of_Phoenix&quot;&gt;The United Federation of Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, a Star Trek fan club. Kandy selected film clips that she felt advanced the story and arranged them in order in the slide carousel. She then manually started the cassette tape player and followed the lyrics along using a script or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard&quot;&gt;storyboard&lt;/a&gt; and  “clicked” the projector to advance each slide. These early fanvids were very much like performance art, as they were done live, were not recorded, and the timing of the clicks had to match the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In April 1976, Kandy took her “little illustrated stories” to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Equicon&quot;&gt;Equicon&lt;/a&gt;, a Los Angeles based science fiction convention with a heavy Star Trek presence:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As a club we were all gonna go over to the very last Equicon/Film Con that &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Bjo_Trimble&quot;&gt;Bjo Trimble&lt;/a&gt; was doing… And I wrote to her, and said, “Hey, I have this thing I’d love to show at your convention.” And she says, “Well, hey, I’m going to be coming in town with my husband, why don’t you show it to me?” … I ended up taking it to the convention and they put us in this little room at the bottom. And she says, “Oh, I’m sure this’ll be a couple of people will want to see it.” Well, it had only like thirty-five people I think that could fit into the room. So they ran it in a loop, for eight hours. People would see it, get out, go back in line again, and then stand in line for an hour and a half so they could see the seven-minute thing again. And so that’s— I knew there was a hunger for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The slideshows were not only popular with fellow fans. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, had been supportive of this sort of fan creativity and engagement for many years. He and his production office had received copies of the first Star Trek fanzine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Spockanalia&quot;&gt;Spockanalia&lt;/a&gt;, and he regularly attended fan conventions. So, when Kandy ran into Gene Roddenberry at Equicon in 1976, she mentioned her slideshows:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So, when he was there, I kinda say, “Hi! I’m glad to see you. By the way, would you sign my, y’know, my club &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Badge&quot;&gt;badge&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m officially a fan of yours,” and he did. And he— and I says, “By the way, I have this idea of putting together a slideshow.” He goes, “Oh, that’s a great idea. I’ve been trying to convince Paramount that there’s enough fan interest in a movie.” And I said, “Great.” So I’m writing to him eventually, and he ended up writing back to me, and oh, I have it in writing, that I can do these slideshows. And in fact, in the future years I ended up visiting a couple of times at Paramount. And he gave me actual slides that were publicity shots, et cetera, from the various sets, so that I could kind of expand my slide shows, and show more….”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Media_Fandom_Oral_History_Project_Interview_with_Kandy_Fong_and_Marnie&quot;&gt;Media Fandom Oral History Project Interview with Kandy Fong and Marnie S&lt;/a&gt; (2012)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In later years, Kandy filmed some of her slideshows for Roddenberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;splash&quot; id=&quot;haiku&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To watch a fanvid is to have a simultaneous three-way conversation with your eyes, your ears and your brain.  And it all takes place within a densely packed four minutes. It is like a haiku on fast forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point, without a means of recording the TV shows or movies and with no private sales of film to consumers, there was no way for fans to access the visual source. Even if fans could access the source, they lacked the ability to edit the source. Vidders were like painters trying to create without paint, brush or canvas. Or to paraphrase Mr. Spock: “They were living in an era of stone knives and bearskins.” This meant that for these first few years, fanvids were limited to slideshows and accompanying audio provided by cassette tape players. It would take the invention of the VCR and its eventual mass marketing to empower fan vidders to add moving images to their creations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;aside class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indulge your inner Geek and dive into the technical differences between &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/w/images/7/72/TDYFRO5Ftpc.png&quot;&gt;Betamax and VHS&lt;/a&gt; videocassette recorders. videocassette recorders.  Read about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr.htm&quot;&gt;inner workings of VCRs&lt;/a&gt; and how the rotating drums translated the 800 feet of tape stored in each video cassette into images and sound.  And join one fan’s adventure with a cranky 35 year old Betamax VCR in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://meeedeee.tumblr.com/post/109185910426/the-vcr-wheel-goes-round-and-round-adventures-in&quot;&gt;The VCR Wheel Goes Round and Round&lt;/a&gt;: Adventures in Early Video Editing.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In September 1975, Betamax became the first videocassette recorder to enter the consumer market. Sony’s Betamax VCR recorder was combined with a 19-inch color TV and sold for $2,495, or around $11,000 in today’s dollars. There were, of course, additional expenses, such as blank cassette tapes: in 1977, the price of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2010/06/0604vhs-ces/&quot;&gt;single blank tape was $20&lt;/a&gt; ($72 in today’s dollars).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By 1980, the VCR’s price had fallen to $1000, or $2800 in today’s dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The cost of owning a VCR, however, was clearly out of reach for most fans, many of whose ages ranged between the teens to their 30s and were either just out of school or starting families.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt2KlIEr5xA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Sony Promotional Video for the first consumer Betamax player sold in the US, the SL-6200 (1975), which was only available as single integrated unit with the Sony color TV console LV-1901. Star Trek makes a brief appearance at 03:36.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GjSpcJv-x4&quot;&gt;Watch a Sony Betamax sales training video from 1977, complete with salesmen role playing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These costs were, however, for the average VCR. Video-editing VCRs remained expensive. In 1993, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Sandy_Herrold&quot;&gt;Sandy Herrold&lt;/a&gt; wrote in the vidding &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Letterzine&quot;&gt;letterzine&lt;/a&gt; Rainbow Noise:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long zine&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Help! I am looking for an editing machine under $600. I want one that will let me hear what I am doing as I am inserting. I’ve looked at a couple of Sonys (though I don’t have the model numbers): one approx. $600, but although it has a wheel on the remote, it doesn’t seem to be a true jog shuttle. (Of course, the next one up ($1000+) has every feature I’ll ever need . . . ) I also looked at a Mitsubishi HS U57. It has a jog shuttle, and a double flying erase head; it’s a little cheaper than the Sony at $525, but I’ve been warned that Mitsubishis start leaving rainbows on your edits 6 months after you buy them. Any truth to this? Anyone had any (bad/good) luck with them? Other recommendations happily accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The VCR recommendations prepared by the editor of that letterzine could not find a VCR with all of Sandy’s features for that price (see table). This means a typical vidder in 1993 would have had to shell out $1000 (today’s dollars) for an editing VCR or pay over $1600 for the full-featured VCR. And it took two VCRs to make a fanvid! Often the only source of a second VCR was to borrow one from another fan or to attend a convention “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Duping&quot;&gt;duping&lt;/a&gt;” room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We will try to have set up both a VTR and a Beta machine in the Video Room for cloning purposes. Head Techie Randy Kaempen is in charge; please contact him if you wish to clone tapes.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/ZebraCon/1980&quot;&gt;Zebracon #2 Program Guide 1980&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Convention&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; VCR was usually donated by an attendee and saw heavy use and sometimes damage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We desperately need a second Beta machine to use in the Video Room, because the one we’ve used for the last two years isn’t up to the strain of non-stop use. Is there anyone out there who’d be willing to bring their machine to use alternately with ours - so that neither VTR would run more than 4 hours at a stretch? There will be a Security guard in the Video Room 24 hours a day, so you need have no worries there!”  &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/ZebraCon/1981&quot;&gt;Zebracon #3 Progress Report&lt;/a&gt; (1981)  &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The security guard mention in the “VTR Wanted” ad was crucial. Because VCRs were so expensive, there was always a risk they could be stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From a 2012 interview with Kandy Fong and Marnie:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Marnie S: The very first &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/IDICon&quot;&gt;IDICon&lt;/a&gt; [in 1984], each of us brought our VCR to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Convention&quot;&gt;con&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we brought them in the day before. And unfortunately, we had help from the staff. We put them all in the room. The next morning they had been stolen. In fact, most of the equipment had been stolen. And that all came off of our insur— our own pockets. My brand-new Beta! The best Beta I ever had. Was stolen.  So that meant we had to scramble for second back-ups, so the quality and the number was not there. But [in spite of that, at these conventions there] was always something which was brand new. People could sign up for slots, to copy or watch tapes. And there were people in that room round the clock for the entire range of the convention.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the Escapade convention in 1993:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long zine&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kandy also had a huge duping room set up; she was doing l-to-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Wiseguy&quot;&gt;Wiseguy&lt;/a&gt; all weekend (a fandom that has been really held back by a lack of good tapes; strangely, considering how recent the show is), and allowing two other 1-to-l duping stations to be filled on a sign-up basis all weekend. She had &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Van_Deusen&quot;&gt;MVD’s&lt;/a&gt;’s vids in varying quality, con compilations, and a lot of eps, including new PAL professionally released Pros, that look pretty darn good.  The clip quality of Pros songtapes should start to climb soon.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: Sandy Herrold, Rainbow Noise #1 (March 1993)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-pictures---now-with-sound&quot;&gt;Moving Pictures - Now With Sound!&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There were still more technical hurdles to overcome: fans could record TV shows off the air and make copies, but they could not replace the TV audio or soundtrack with music. That is, until manufacturers began including the “Audio Dub” feature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“On nearly all recording VTRs, new sound can be added or DUBBED after the initial recording without erasing the picture. However, the original sound is erased on that portion of the recording where the new sound is added.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/front/front.html&quot;&gt;The Video Guide by Charles Bensinger (c) 1981&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was possible because while the audio was stored in two locations on the videotape, the video was stored in only one location. It meant that the one audio section that was stored separately could be replaced without overwriting the video.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/320/history/vhsfmt.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/320/vhsfmt.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/480/vhsfmt.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/history/640/vhsfmt.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/history/980/vhsfmt.jpg 980w, /assets/pics/posts/history/1280/vhsfmt.jpg 1280w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Hi-Fi and Video stored in the center, Mono audio at the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/320/history/sound-on-video.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/320/sound-on-video.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/480/sound-on-video.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/history/640/sound-on-video.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/history/980/sound-on-video.jpg 980w, /assets/pics/posts/history/1280/sound-on-video.jpg 1280w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; In later years, audio dubbing replaced only the mono track with the song music. The original movie/TV dialog and music remained on the Hi-fi track.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When the edited (or dubbed) tape was played back, on these later VCRs, the playback sound had to be set to “Mono”. Otherwise, the original audio would play, not the song music. A VCR could be set to play only the new mono track, but if a fan forgot to make the switch, they might get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CIo9pfLNRI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An example audio “dubbing”. The first series of clips are taken from the TV show Starsky &amp;amp;Hutch that have been edited together to make a songvid. In these original clips, you can hear snippets of the original dialogue and some of the TV soundtrack. The second series of clips has the new music inserted over the clips. The combination of edited video clips and new audio music track = a fanvid.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, these first VCRs were easier to play back because they replaced all the original audio. But these early experiments carried their own set of problems. While the audio could be replaced, editing the video could cause video distortion. This meant that only single long scenes could be used with the audio being supplied from a video cassette player that was connected to the VCR’s “audio in” inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

Diana lugged her &lt;a href=&quot;http://vintageelectronics.betamaxcollectors.com/rcaselectavisionvhsvcrmodelvct200.html&quot;&gt;40 pound RCA VHS machine&lt;/a&gt; over to Kendra’s house. Kendra had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vintageelectronics.betamaxcollectors.com/magnavoxvhsvcrmodelvh8200br01.html&quot;&gt;Magnavox VHS&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel-to-reel_audio_tape_recording&quot;&gt;reel to reel audio tape&lt;/a&gt; player. Diana had been wondering what the ‘audio dub’ button on her machine was for. Since they had some of the last season of Starsky &amp;amp; Hutch on a video cassette, they paused a picture on one machine, started the song playing, and hit record on the second machine. …..The vidders decided they wanted action!! But, Diana and Kendra found that if they recorded one scene and then try to record another one after it, they got several seconds of static, unstable images, and music interruption. Their solution was to find one long scene and add music. … “ &lt;cite&gt;Source: Morgan Dawn, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/File:Vividcon_2008_History_of_Fan_Vidding.pdf&quot;&gt;History of Vidding: 1980-1984&lt;/a&gt;, PDF of panel notes presented at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vividcon&quot;&gt;Vividcon&lt;/a&gt; 2008.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An example of a “single scene vid” is a moment from Starsky &amp;amp; Hutch where the two main characters are drinking in sorrow after the death of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/David_Starsky&quot;&gt;Dave Starsky’s&lt;/a&gt;’s girlfriend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Terry_Roberts&quot;&gt;Terry&lt;/a&gt;. The music selected for the vid was Bette Midler’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR6okRuOLc8&quot;&gt;The Rose&lt;/a&gt;.” The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ByDJ2-_ZdmU?t=50m49s&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; was 3:40 minutes long and its length perfectly matched that of the Midler song.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, after making a few vids, Kendra and Diana discovered that if they paused the videotape in the recording VCR before editing, the action scene they edited in afterwards looked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;VCR 1 was the playback VCR, where they would locate a specific clip from the Starsky &amp;amp;Hutch episodes that they had recorded off air. VCR 1 was then connected to…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;VCR 2 (the recording VCR). This is the VCR where the editing took place. The snippets of TV footage from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Starsky_%26_Hutch&quot;&gt;Starsky &amp;amp; Hutch&lt;/a&gt; would be reassembled into a new “storyline”. VCR 2 would be hooked up to a TV to see and hear the edits. And (not shown here), a cassette player would be connected to the audio inputs on VCR 2 to “dub” in the new music. Usually the music was added first before the new clips were inserted so the vidder could match the visuals to the music as they worked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By 1980, fans could obtain source material (record off-air or trade for copies recorded off air), and they could edit the tape and replace the audio with music. But they still faced significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finding the desired clips required staring at towers of videotapes and fast forwarding through each tape, one by one, to find the right scene. Videotape is fragile and subject to breakage and tangling, and these snarls could render a VCR permanently inoperable. Timing the “edit in” and “edit out” points of a scene was manual. In early days, some VCRs did not even have hour/minute counters to show you how far you had advanced into the tape. Fans used stopwatches to give them the information they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once a fan had queued up the tape on recording VCR 2, they then queued up the scene on playback VCR 1 and had to manually hit play. Then, with a finger poised over the record button on VCR 2, the vidder had to rely on hand-eye coordination and a sense of timing to hit the record button. It could take up to a dozen tries to insert a single clip correctly. And there was no undo button - all edits were live and irreversible.  Another additional stress: each time a fan hit play and record, this compromised the videotape further and further, risking it warping and warbling. Each edit was an exercise in breathless fear, frustration, and hopeful anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even non-vidding fans ended up stressing their videotapes beyond endurance by watching and re-watching their favorite scenes.  As one vidder wrote in  1993:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long zine&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is possible to love a tape to death. Recently, I borrowed a series from another fan, and I can tell where every one of her favorite scenes is located. Every time she paused the tape - backed it up - paused the tape - replayed it  (sometimes in slow motion), the tape stretched a little bit. Now her favorite scenes are bracketed with wavy pictures and rolling images.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some vidders were better at this timing than others. Familiarity with the quirks of the machine was also essential. Each VCR had a “rollback” that was unique. Rollback is when the drum head of the VCR that reads the videotape rewinds the tape slightly to “grab” enough tape to start recording. In doing so, it erases first few seconds of the previous scene.  The rollback could be as few as two seconds or as many as seven seconds of tape. Or there could be no rollback at all.  Having a VCR with consistent rollback was crucial. As Morgan Dawn explained in the mid-1990s: “Vidding on someone else’s VCR was like having sex with someone’s else husband. You know all the right moves, but your timing is way off.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: Morgan Dawn’s personal notes, used with permission.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1986 one woman wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been making &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Simon&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt; (and S/S) songtapes—but before y’all rush off letters to me asking for copies—gasp. Remember my niece, the one who just got Simonized? The one who sits up all night watching my tapes as I sleep, so that I was worried that she’d wear the machines and/or the tapes out? Well, I got home from work yesterday to find a tape stuck in my machine. Not just any tape mind you, but a tape of all the new S&amp;amp;S episodes I’d just cloned and hadn’t watched that closely yet. GAH! Dead niece! Sick VCR! No more songtapes! AAAARGH! I’d put an ill VCR and a stuck tape right up there with a major death in the family. //double tragedy, what with the untimely demise of your niece, and all….//”

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another “feature” of analog vidding is that a vid has to be made in order, from start to finish. While a fan could theoretically insert a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Clip&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of a vid, they ran into the problem of erasing the following clip if they did not hit the “pause” button while recording. This is why early analog vidders created storyboards and planned out their vids ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1986, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Van_Deusen&quot;&gt;Mary Suskind Lansing&lt;/a&gt; wrote an essay about the mechanics of fanvids for the Star Trek fanzine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Consort&quot;&gt;Consort&lt;/a&gt; #2. She explained the design process of a fanvid:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have a written set of lyrics of the song, ideally written only on the left half of the page to leave the right half available for notes. Give yourself at least a few hours over showers and driving to think about the song to see if there are any natural patterns which will lend the song to becoming something more than just a composite of random video shots.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The early storyboards were handwritten or typed up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Typewriter&quot;&gt;typewriters&lt;/a&gt;. In later years, word-processing made the process of listing possible scenes much easier. Stanzas would be assigned an over-arching meaning or theme, and the vidder listed images that seemed to match the themes. The location of the scene on the source tape would also be noted. See the slideshow for storyboard examples.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not all vidders used storyboards, however.  With the introduction of more advanced VCR editing tools in the 1990s, some vidders such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Media_Cannibals&quot;&gt;Media Cannibals&lt;/a&gt; dropped them altogether. As one of the members of this vidding collective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Rachael_Sabotini&quot;&gt;Rache&lt;/a&gt;, explained: &lt;q&gt;We didn’t use stop watches or storyboard out a vid; we did it on the fly with insert edits combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Flying_Erase_Head&quot;&gt;flying eraseheads&lt;/a&gt;, listening to the music and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Sandy_Herrold&quot;&gt;Sandy’s&lt;/a&gt; amazing eye-hand coordination.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: Rache’s personal notes, used with permission.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because these early vidders did not have access to dissolves, transitions or any other effects, they relied on existing scene changes to create motion in a vid.  Also, because the fan edits were made manually and VCRs had rollback, tight edits or short clips were difficult to manage.  This may be one of the reasons that early fanvids relied heavily on the song’s lyrics to make the point and often ignored what was taking place musically:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mary Suskind Lansing explained:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The most ideal situation…  is to have the video actually show scenes which are consonant with the meaning of the story told by the song. In the song “Home Again” by Carole King, the words can be nicely carried by a set of videos showing one of our heroes in a difficult situation from which they would ideally like to be removed, for example, Spock on the Galileo Seven, trying to return to the Enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source: Mary Suskind Lansing, “Making Your Own Song Tapes,” from Consort #2 (Dec. 1986)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By focusing on the lyrics, the vidder need to make one or two edits per stanza.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To the modern ear and eye some of these older vids can come across as literal, full of talking heads and static shots.  However, keep in mind that to this new fanvid audience, the act of simultaneously interpreting both images and lyrics was unfamiliar:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Think all the time about the fact that you are working in a very different medium. With a book, you can always go back and check what you just read. With a song tape, the music and video pass through your mind and you can’t go back to check. This means that some levels of subtlety will never be visible to your audience.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source: Mary Suskind Lansing, “Making Your Own Song Tapes,” from Consort #2 (Dec. 1986)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Others cautioned against literalism or simple retelling the same story as depicted in the movie or the TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though you’ve planned to simply illustrate a song with your favorite characters, you will probably find yourself revealing something about the character or making a point here or there along the way. Go with it – you have something to say. Ideally, each video should be a mini-movie with a beginning, middle and end. Your opening image should be very strong, should grab the viewer’s eye to pull her into the song. The final image should somehow signify a closing, and leave a strong impression as well.  Besides having something to say, ideally a song tape should make over the original material – both the audio recording and the video source material – into something new. Strive to learn to manipulate and transform your material instead of just letting unedited video run past an entire verse of a song, or simply re-telling an episode.

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that all early vidders lacked the understanding of complex vid design or story telling. It was that they lacked the tools. In her 1986 essay, Mary Suskind Lansing explained the concept of visual story bracketing: &lt;q&gt;A simple, but effective, idea is to use visual brackets at the beginning and end of the song to set the meaning of the song. This is most effective if you can carry the same brackets into the middle of the song as well. A song with a refrain allows you to use the refrain to carry this bracket. For example, the song “Slipsliding Away” by Simon and Garfunkel can take the theme of the uneasy relationship between Spock and Sarek. By breaking the refusion scene on Vulcan, from beginning to end, into pieces and using them during the refrains, the entire song has a greater visual consistency.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: Mary Suskind Lansing, “Making Your Own Song Tapes,” from Consort #2 (Dec. 1986)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;editing-challenges-part-3-show-me-the-good-stuff-video-tape-quality&quot;&gt;Editing Challenges Part 3: Show Me The Good Stuff: Video Tape Quality:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even though VCRs were available to US consumers by 1975, the main source of video came from off-air recordings. In 1977, a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://entertainment-industry.knoji.com/the-history-of-the-vhs-movie-industry/&quot;&gt;Magnetic Video acquired license rights to 50 of Twentieth Century Fox’s movies&lt;/a&gt;. They sold for $80 each, or around $300 in today’s dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the consumer sale of TVs series tapes lagged, and it was not until the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/what-was-the-first-complete-tv-series-on-vhs.255334/&quot;&gt;mid-to-late 1980s&lt;/a&gt; that   TV episodes were available for purchase. Also, series in syndication were not carried in all markets in the US, episodes were often not aired in order, episodes were dropped, and many were edited down for commercials. Until that time, fans had to make do with off-air recordings. A fan who had uncut episodes of a TV show like Star Trek, Man from U.N.C.L.E., or Starsky &amp;amp; Hutch was considered the pot of gold at the end of the videotape rainbow. This meant that there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/File_Sharing#Tape_Trading&quot;&gt;there was a robust fan-to-fan trading network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/320/history/code-table.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/320/code-table.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/480/code-table.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/history/640/code-table.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/history/980/code-table.jpg 980w, /assets/pics/posts/history/1280/code-table.jpg 1280w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A code table from &quot;[APA-VCR](http://fanlore.org/wiki/APA-VCR),&quot; a fanzine where fans could trade videotapes; it ran from 1979 until the 1990s. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next subject a vidder needed to be knowledge about when buying or trading tapes was videotape quality.  This was because when each copy of a videotape was made, there was s&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sivideo.com/9vterms.htm&quot;&gt;ignal loss&lt;/a&gt; due to magnetic tape’s inability to transmit data and imperfections in electronic circuitry in reading that data; colors bled, clarity was reduced, and grain increased. This was called generation loss. Knowing whether a copy of a VCR tape was “1st Gen” (copied only once from the master video tape) or “2nd Gen” (copy of a copy) was important, because by the very act of editing a video, and then making copies to share, took up two “generations”. By the time fans reached “5th gen” or “6th gen” copies, the video was often so badly degraded faces were blobs and sound was warbling and tinny.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mES3CHEnVyI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;aside class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent videotape quality was not the only reason early vidders tried to control tape distribution.  In 1991, a well-meaning fan showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/California_Crew&quot;&gt;California Crew’s&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Oh_Boy_%28Quantum_Leap_vid%29&quot;&gt;Oh Boy&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/w/index.php?title=You_Can_Call_Me_Al&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;You Can Call Me Al&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap&quot;&gt;Quantum Leap&lt;/a&gt; vids to a convention staffer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Creation_Con&quot;&gt;Creation Con&lt;/a&gt; who had them re-made for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Procon&quot;&gt;professionally-run conventions&lt;/a&gt; without California Crew’s knowledge or consent.  According to fans who saw these versions of the vids, Creation Con did a terrible job, adding insult to injury.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because of this, California Crew began to strictly control distribution of their vids, with most fans only getting to see them when the vids were shown at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/MediaWest*Con&quot;&gt;MediaWest Con&lt;/a&gt;. Source: California Crew. You can see a snippet of the “Oh Boy” video on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdzPnWpONx0&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1996, one vidder posted the following notice in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Adzine&quot;&gt;adzine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another factor that impacted videotape quality was recording speed. Videotapes could be recorded at:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“SP” (Standard Play) with 2 hours of video per tape&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“LP” (Long Play) with 4 hours of video per tape&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“EP” (Extended Play) with 6 hours of video per tape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;SP videotape recordings were in high demand with vidders because they offered better video resolution. Non-vidders would often record at LP or EP record album in order to save money and shelf space. To give an idea of the economic savings: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/video-here-stay&quot;&gt;in 1987, the cost of a single blank video tape in today’s dollars was $10.&lt;/a&gt;. This meant that a single season of Miami Vice recorded off-air in SP would cost a fan around $122 but only $40 if it were recorded at EP speed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of course, there were added complications! TV shows that aired in Europe were recorded in a different format, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL&quot;&gt;PAL&lt;/a&gt;. PAL tapes could not play in US machines (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An additional challenge: because there was little commercial sales of British TV shows in the US, only a few British shows were ever aired in the US. This meant if one was a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Doctor_Who&quot;&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Professionals&quot;&gt;The Professionals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Blake%27s_7&quot;&gt;Blake’s 7&lt;/a&gt;, one had to hope your local public TV would buy the rights to the show and air them so you could record them. In the 1990s, this meant there was a market for fans selling higher quality copies of these British shows to US vidders, at a whopping $15 per tape ($23 per tape in today’s dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;editing-challenges-part-4-macrovision-was-a-dirty--word&quot;&gt;Editing Challenges Part 4: Macrovision Was A Dirty  Word:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With off-air recording deemed legal, the entertainment industry shifted their focus to the sale of movie videotapes. By the mid-1980s, video rental stores emerged, and rather than embracing the new consumer model, the studios once again miss-stepped, this time suing to stop videocassette rentals. When this tactic failed, the studios dramatically increased the prices of movies on VCR for home purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The studios then countered by raising the prices of the movies and by 1983, some titles were up to $79.99 SRP [$190 per tape in 2016 dollars]. The rising prices also meant an increase in illegal copying.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://entertainment-industry.knoji.com/the-history-of-the-vhs-movie-industry/&quot;&gt;The History Of The VHS Movie Industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once again, the studios attempted to solve a problem that they had partially self-created. In 1982, they introduced an anti-copying technology known as “Macrovision.” During playback to another recording &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr.htm&quot;&gt;VCR&lt;/a&gt;, Macrovision would turn the video signal fuzzy and the brightness and color would fade in and out. While the casual consumer was prevented from making copies, professional pirates soon found a way to circumvent the wavering signal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/320/history/scrambled.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/320/scrambled.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/history/480/scrambled.jpg 480w, /assets/pics/posts/history/640/scrambled.jpg 640w, /assets/pics/posts/history/980/scrambled.jpg 980w, /assets/pics/posts/history/1280/scrambled.jpg 1280w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Videotape with Macrovision. Image Source: Wikipedia.    “The way the copy protection signal works is interesting. It’s not that the second VCR “knows” that the video signal is coming from a video tape. It’s that the signal coming from the original video tape contains a special type of noise that the TV set doesn’t notice but a VCR cannot handle. This noise signal confuses a component, known as an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit, in the VCR, and the confused AGC records the signal incorrectly.”  Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question313.htm&quot;&gt;How does copy protection on a video tape work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since most fans obtained their sources off-air or from other fans, Macrovision was not a problem for the first few years. However, vidders who wanted to use cinema sources wrestled with various “video clarifying” devices designed to strip away the encryption ‘noise’ and generate a clear unprotected signal. If a fan didn’t have access to the devices, the alternatives were few:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you can hang on, the movie may later come out in a sell-thru version that isn’t encoded. (Perhaps you can borrow a friend’s copy, or another video fannish helper may know for sure.) Or wait until it hits pay-per-view (which usually happens around the time it hits video), HBO or Showtime, or other TV, and get a first gen from that. (Even if it’s chopped to ribbons on network TV, you might still get useable footage from what’s left.)” &lt;cite&gt;Source:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Mary Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, Making Fannish Music Videos  (3rd revision, 1997)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When a TV series eventually became available for commercial resale, those vidders relying on TV footage faced the same limited choices. It is not surprising that when the third season of the TV show &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Highlander&quot;&gt;Highlander&lt;/a&gt; was released without copy-guard in 1997, vidders on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Virgule_Mailing_List&quot;&gt;Virgule-L&lt;/a&gt; mailing list rejoiced:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Highlander professional tapes are NOT copy protected. I was so sure they would be. We just got season 3 and taped Methos last night (don’t want to wear out the original) and there wasn’t any problem!” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Stacy_D&quot;&gt;Stacy D’s&lt;/a&gt; post to the Virgule-L mailing list dated Jan 16, 1997, quoted with permission.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, even when the signals were stripped and copied over to an unprotected tape, Macrovison could still reappear in the next copy, lingering like a dormant virus. This was most likely because the signal stripping devices could not always completely remove the Macrovision and stray signals “leaked” through to be copied onto the next tape. This is one reason why “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Data's_Dream&quot;&gt;Data’s Dream&lt;/a&gt;”, a popular 1990s fanvid was remastered in 2004; the vidders could not reliably remove the Macrovision from the original tape to create additional copies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;editing-challenges-part-5-rainbow-noise-flying-erase-heads-jog-shuttles-and-dirty-frames&quot;&gt;Editing Challenges Part 5: Rainbow Noise, Flying Erase Heads, Jog Shuttles and Dirty Frames:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another technological challenge in early vidding was the dreaded “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Rainbow_Noise&quot;&gt;Rainbow Noise&lt;/a&gt;” which could only be defeated by its arch-rival “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Flying_Erase_Head&quot;&gt;The Flying Erase Head&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;zine&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So what is a flying erase head? Contrary to its name, it isn’t something out of David Lynch’s nightmares, it’s a moving head that erases the partial frames left by editing, for a clean, flashless cut. Without a flying erase head, the rainbow noise between cuts is very annoying, especially in later generations (copies). I don’t recommend working without this feature.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source:  Rainbow Noise #1, March 1993&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But alas, the life cycle of a flying erase head was limited, and most vidding VCRs buckled under the pressure of a vidder’s atypical heavy use:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long zine&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Flying erase heads - though necessary, these are a pain in the butt. As far as I know, all erase heads in home machines deteriorate somewhat after a few months of hard use. And let’s face it, we song vid makers give a VCR harder use than manufacturers count on.  Hint: to check how cleanly your erase head is working, check the top of the screen for little flashes of black or white at the cuts. This garbage makes for a more jarring cut, but isn’t uncommon (you can always lay in the cut again, if it’s too noticeable, since the problem is usually intermittent). But if you start getting big, flashy rainbows, the head has stopped working, and should be serviced For reasons like this, do get an extended warranty instead of 90 days!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another important feature to have in a 1990-era VCR vidding was a “jog shuttle.” Situated on either the VCR remote or the front of the VCR (or both), the jog shuttle allowed the vidder to scroll back and forth on the videotape frame by frame from. This allowed one to insert a new clip more precisely. It also allowed video editors the ability to edit out “dirty frames” - the leftover frames from the previous clip that remained after inserting new clips. As Mary Schmidt explained: &lt;q&gt;I use my jog shuttle to pause the editing VCR on the very first frame of the clip I’m re-doing. Try this and see if your edit is clean. If you get a frame of the old clip (do the replay in frame-by-frame) you’ll have to pause the editing VCR on the last frame of the previous clip (or the last frame of black space if it’s your first clip). Leaving in those stray frames will cause a jump instead of a clean edit. A jog shuttle makes this part really easy.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source:  Mary Schmidt, Making Fannish Music Videos  (3rd revision, 1997)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So what did an ideal VCR editing setup look like? A vidder in 1993 asked:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long zine&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What do the rest of you use, and what do you like and dislike about it? I do my viewing and taping with an RCA VR 740 (Panasonic-made, ‘91, $800, SVHS), which has the best picture I’ve ever seen unless you go to studio quality. Though it has edit features, including a jog/shuttle, I don’t use it for dubbing because like many ‘90-92 models, there is a large, inconsistent rollback (37-45 frames! No precision is possible with that variation—beats missed all over the place).  During vidding, it’s my source.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My editing machine is [Vidder GF’s] (non-Panasonic) RCA VR 685 (‘91, $599), which has a very precise Jog/shuttle and consistent 4 frame rollback. Though the picture is grainy compared to the VR 740, it’s a dream to edit with. BUT-I’ve had to learn to get along without hearing the music as I work. This means I must edit in order, since if you can’t hear the music, you must run a little over. For me, this was a little disorienting at first, but no major problem, since I have always preferred working in order, for a specific reason. True, It means I must have the main drift of the vid clear In my mind before I edit. But whether or not you can hear the musk, I strongly recommend working in order, since no one’s finger is frame-accurate.” &lt;cite&gt;Source:  Rainbow Noise  #1 (March 1993)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;editing-challenges-part-6-just-the-straight-cuts-maam-nothing-fancy&quot;&gt;Editing Challenges Part 6: Just The Straight Cuts Ma’am, Nothing Fancy:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because VCR editing used existing analog source (videotape), there was no ability to materially alter the source. This meant vidders could not add transitions, dissolves or cross-fades beyond those that were already placed into the original video. Fans would make special note of these existing effects because by re-purposing them, they allowed a vidder to vary the flow of their vid. Color correction, lightening or darkening video, speeding up or slowing down clips - all of these tools remained out of reach for the majority of analog vidders who had not access to special high end commercial editing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even the ability to make fast paced edits was challenging for many vidders. Starting and stopping both the playback and recording VCR required quick reflexes and perfect timing and even with the nimblest editor, there was always a lag due to the mechanical parts of the VCR.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For this reason, many of the fanvids of the 1980s favored long clips that could last an entire stanza. There were exceptions of course: in the late 1980s and early 1990s the vidding team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Shadow_Songs&quot;&gt;Shadow Songs&lt;/a&gt;, was well known for their rapid-fire edits that were perfectly timed to the beat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, two vidding groups, the Media Cannibals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/JKL&quot;&gt;JKL&lt;/a&gt; spent considerable time focusing on timing both the edits as well as the arranging flow of their scenes to hit the beats and key musical stress points.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With more finely tuned VCR equipment, vidders could start focusing on what the music beneath the lyrics was doing, turning two dimensional vids into an exercise in multi-dimensional composition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Continental Drift is a Blake’s 7 fanvid edited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Tashery_Shannon&quot;&gt;Tashery&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Shadow Songs. The vid is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Character_study&quot;&gt;character study&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Avon&quot;&gt;Avon&lt;/a&gt; and was highly regarded for the timing of its fast edits and cuts, particularly in the last 30 seconds, something that was difficult to achieve in analog VCR vidding. In 2009, the vid was shown at Vividcon’s “Envelope Pushers of the Past” &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Vid_show&quot;&gt;vid show&lt;/a&gt;. The vid was also discussed that year at Vividcon’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://vividcon.info/vidshows/112/&quot;&gt;History of Vidding 1985-1990&lt;/a&gt;”: “What made this vid stand out was the music choice, very unique selection for a fanvid for its time.  She treated the vid like a story by using her edits to build to a narrative climax.” Source: Fanlore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Continental_Drift&quot;&gt;Continental Drift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;editing-challenges-part-7-audio-editing-whats-that&quot;&gt;Editing Challenges Part 7: Audio Editing, What’s That?&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Likewise, editing the audio source was difficult. Cassette tape editing decks could only remove music. Adding music or rearranging stanzas was jarring and obvious.  Like video, there was no ability to use dissolves or fades and layering the original audio soundtrack over the music or changing volume and pitch was not possible.  CDs could not be edited, so vidders would often copy the music onto a cassette deck recorder, manually edit it there, and then feed that version back into the VCR. Each copy resulted in a reduction of audio quality. The audio edits were hard and abrupt and usually unpleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the mid 1990s, when Media Cannibals used a Billy Bragg song “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1MPF6gOHXc&quot;&gt;Tender Comrade&lt;/a&gt;” they struggled to find a way to remove the long silent pauses between lyrics. The pauses would, they felt, slowed down and interrupted the flow of the vid. The vidders ran the CD into an audiocassette tape deck and manually started and stopped the tape to edit out the silence. Because cassette deck counters were not precise and because there was a hard limit on the time it took to stop and start the tape, another a second person had to manually clap out beats so they could approximately edit out the same amount of dead space from each stanza.  They also edited the song to remove several lines. This means that the video’s music is over forty seconds shorter than the original. You can view the video here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another technique vidders used was to play the CD directly onto the videotape, using “waste footage” as the video base. This base would be replaced by TV and movie clips later.  Rache from Media Cannibals remembers:  “I know that in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Professionals&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/a&gt; video “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Media_Cannibals/Tape1&quot;&gt;You’re My Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;
“, the lyrics mention  “girl”. Because the video is about two men, Sandy deliberately lowered the volume at the section while we were recording it onto the video tape.  After the word she raised the volume for the rest of the song.   We also cut out entire verses, using Sandy’s musical ear and her skilled eye to stop and start the videotape as the music was fed into the VCR.  That’s what we did with our Highlander vid “Us”.  In order to distract the viewer from the bad mesh on the audio edit, we put in what was then considered ‘fast cuts’. You can see those edits around 2:09 in the vid. It seemed to work great at the time, but of course now those edits are not considered fast at all.”  Source: Rache’s personal notes, used with permission.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another notable exception from the 1990s was Shadow Song’s Wisgeuy vid “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Nights_in_White_Satin&quot;&gt;Nights in White Satin&lt;/a&gt;” which used Moody Blue’s music as the backdrop to a dramatic scene between two male characters, with the actors speaking their lines over the music playing in the background. Through careful editing, the vidders were able to graft the TV scene with the original dialog and music onto the studio-recorded version of the song. This was then matched with different clips from the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;

So, in the fall of 1980, Kendra, Diana, and their 40-pound VCR left California and went on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kendra and Diana found a friend with nice handwriting, and used a camera for the credits. [Other friends] helped them with source material and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Song_Choice&quot;&gt;song choices&lt;/a&gt;. But, none of their friends knew exactly what Kendra and Diana were doing. They made 20 songs videos by Z-Con 2 ….They carefully put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Gen&quot;&gt;gen&lt;/a&gt; on one tape and the ‘underground’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Slash&quot;&gt;slash&lt;/a&gt; on a different tape. The night before the con, Diana decide that they needed more credits…..Diana and Kendra spent the con inviting people into their room to share their &lt;em&gt;crack&lt;/em&gt;. i.e. vids. They blew everyone away - no one had seen anything like that. They spent the whole con showing their work over and over, and explaining how they did it. The next year, 1981, sixteen people showed up with vids they had made, and they were inviting people into &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; rooms.”  &lt;cite&gt;Source:   History of Vidding: 1980-1984 (PDF of panel notes presented at Vividcon 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The song tapes at ZebraCon were a big hit and were the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Letter_of_Comment&quot;&gt;letters of comment&lt;/a&gt; to the fan-published letterzine,  &lt;q&gt;S and H”: “Thanks, Diana, for playing your VTR S&amp;amp;H song tapes over and ever and over … and over, it was greatly appreciated&lt;/q&gt; wrote one fan after the convention. &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/S_and_H_(Starsky_and_Hutch_letterzine)&quot;&gt;S and H&lt;/a&gt; #16 (Dec. 1980)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next year, Kendra submitted a notice to the same Starsky &amp;amp;Hutch letterzine in Oct 1981: &lt;q&gt;I hope all of you are as excited about Z-Con III as Diana and I are. This gathering of fans has the potential of being the most exciting events of our time… Diana and I will be bringing our song tape. I will be shown in our room, 201. The schedule will be posted on the door. We are looking forward to seeing what others have done in this area. The grapevine says that new and exciting adventures are being taking into this medium of artistic expression.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: S and H #26 (Oct. 1981)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fandom enthusiasm for songvids did not go unnoticed, and after Zebracon III, the convention &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Convention_Committee&quot;&gt;organizers&lt;/a&gt; asked: &lt;q&gt;Is it worth continuing the video room [at Zcon 4]? Should we have a special time for people to watch song tapes?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: S and H #28 (Dec. 1981)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the crowd grew too large for the hotel rooms and convention “vidshows” were created to accommodate the growing number of fans who wanted to see the vids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Large group showings of fanvids were not immediately embraced. Part of this had to do with the fluid legal status of early video recording technology.  In 1976, the TV and movie industry sued Sony, the manufacturer of the Betamax VCR, alleging that because Sony was building a device that could be used for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement&quot;&gt;copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that therefore Sony should be liable for any infringement committed by VCR consumers. By 1978, the court had ruled in favor of Sony, but a few years later, the appeals court reversed and ruled in favor the movie industry. The result was the case being sent up to the US Supreme Court.

  &lt;p&gt;This legal wrangling led ZebraCon to put the brakes on vidshows. In 1982, worries over the legality of videotaping and showing videos led ZebraCon to announce:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Due to the ambiguity of the current legal situation concerning videotapes, ZEBRACON is not programming any video presentation, and therefore, membership to ZEBRACON in no way constitutes payment for the viewing of video programs. We will, however, provide space for videophiles to get together for private showings of their favorite tapes….A sign-up sheet will be posted on the door, and if  you have any tape you’d like to show - and a machine to use - you can choose a time and list it on the board. We cannot provide video machines or tapes this year, sorry” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/ZebraCon/1981&quot;&gt;ZebraCon #3 Progress Report&lt;/a&gt; #1-3 (1982).&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fans’ reluctance continued through 1984:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is no &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Video_Room&quot;&gt;video room&lt;/a&gt;, as such, again this year. We stopped having one be cause of all the legal confusion and ambiguities; last time we provided a room for people who wanted to bring their own machines and tapes, but everyone just showed tapes in their rooms and it was wasted. So, this time you are totally on your own as far as video goes. There will be a message board set up at Registration, and anyone wishing to show tapes in her room could put an announcement up there.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/ZebraCon/1984&quot;&gt;ZebraCon #5 Progress Report&lt;/a&gt; #1 (1984)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In December 1984, the US Supreme ruled that “time-shifting” (recording a free TV show for later viewing) was lawful “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fair_Use&quot;&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;” and was not copyright infringement.  &lt;cite&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://eightiesclub.tripod.com&quot;&gt;Supreme Court Rules Home Use of VCRS Okay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Earlier that year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/MediaWest*Con&quot;&gt;MediaWestCon&lt;/a&gt;, another fan-run media fandom convention, held its first “Film/Video Competition.” Also in 1984, the second annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Dark_Shadows_Festival&quot;&gt;Dark Shadows Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Newark, NJ in July sponsored its own event: &lt;q&gt;A music video featuring relevant scenes from “Dark Shadows” set to such popular tunes:  “Who Can It Be Now?”, “You Can Do Magic·’, and “Memory (Theme From “Cats”)”, [The songtape] was prepared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Overstreet&quot;&gt;Mary Overstreet&lt;/a&gt;, Carol Maschke and Kathleen Reynolds. Their tape was very entertaining and much enjoyed by all.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_World_of_Dark_Shadows/Issues_31-40&quot;&gt;The World of Dark Shadows&lt;/a&gt; #38&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By 1986, the ZebraCon video room was back showing Starsky &amp;amp;Hutch and The Professionals &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Songtapes&quot;&gt;songtapes&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1989, the con began hosting a Friday Night Song Tape Contest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;convention-vidshows---part-3-structuring-a-vidshow&quot;&gt;Convention Vidshows - Part 3: Structuring A Vidshow:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Legal issues aside, the technical hurdles of these early vidshows were formidable. Larger venues dwarfed the relatively small 19-inch TV screens. Sound quality was poor with only the built-in TV speakers. The TV often had to be mounted on a table or tall stand. Seating was limited to ballroom chairs and those in the back had to peer between audience heads.  Convention attendees would wait an hour in advance of the vidshow to secure a “good” seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Early vidders dreamed of seeing their vids on the big screen. What they got was much different.  Source: Getty Images, editorial license.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Additional technical challenges were created when the two competing VCR formats, Betamax and VHS, emerged. Since Betamax was first to market, and was perceived to have better picture quality, many of the early vidders favored that format. Later entrants found themselves at a disadvantage because small fan-run conventions could not afford to host both VCR formats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From 1986 ZebraCon: &lt;q&gt;A few S&amp;amp;S episodes were shown at the Con, but as they only had Beta machines (boo, hiss, and no VHS), I couldn’t show anybody the stuff I’d brought with me. We’ve been making S&amp;amp;S (and S/S) songtapes.&lt;/q&gt;  &lt;cite&gt;Source: convention report in Simon and Simon Investigations #2 (July 1986)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of course, once VHS gained popularity the pendulum shifted against Betamax VCRs. By 1989, the MediaWest*Con vid contest announced they would only be accepting vids on VHS tape.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The audience experience at these early vidshows was often characterized by stops and starts with repetitive sequences of vids stemming from the same TV shows, using the same popular clips. If the convention could obtain both VCR equipment formats, they would show all the Betamax vids first, then disconnect the Betamax VCR from the TV, connect the VHS VCR to the TV, and finally show the VHS vids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even after the industry settled on a single format by the 1990s, vidshows remained uneven. Vidders or vidding collectives had to submit their entries on a single tape. When the tape ended, the show would stop to allow the next tape to be inserted into the VCR. Sometimes in order to create a better audience experience, vidshow organizers would copy all the vid entries onto a single tape. This resulted the loss of video and sound quality. While it made the audience happy, it also made some vidders unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition to grouping vids by a single vidder or collective onto single tape, the content of the vids themselves ended up grouped together, in ways that audiences could find boring. A vidder who assembled six Star Trek vids and submitted those six vids, forced the audience to watch one after another. If a fandom was popular, the audience could be overwhelmed with fanvids from the same movie or TV series, with vidders often selecting the same iconic scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Two of my friends] were really in to Voyager, and had made an hour of Voyager….vids. And their main thing that they were interested in was Paris and B’Elanna, so there was an hour of vids about Paris and B’Elanna. And, you know, that’s fine; I just felt that, for a vid show, that there should be a little bit of variety. This is something actually that California Crew told me, that I apparently still remembered, from their first vid panel that I went to.  That there should be a variety of tone, of fast/slow, ballad/funny, you know, just to keep the audience interested. And I was like, ok, well, all right. If I manage to finish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 vid at the con, there will be, we can have half an hour of Paris and B’Elanna, then my vid, then another half hour of Paris and B’Elanna.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would be better if we could like divide it into thirds…..  And of course then when they put them all together they did an hour of Paris and B’Elanna and put my two at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source:  Media Fandom Oral History Project Interview with Judy Chien (2012)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;aside class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s vidshows are carefully curated, varying the order of the vids to arrange them by pacing, theme, and subject matter. Read about one “VJs” experience in designing a vidshow at SDWolfpup’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://sdwolfpup.dreamwidth.org/595386.html&quot;&gt;Vidshow Construction Talk&lt;/a&gt;” (2012)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While most early vidshows would take any and all vids, some concoms started imposing limits, both in number of vids submitted, and in content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By 1991, so many videos were submitted to the MediaWest*Con fan video contest that the concom instituted a fifteen-minute-per-person limit. Vidding collectives could enter fifteen minutes per person in the group. Anything entered over that limit could still be shown at a time other than Friday night and any other “competition” re-runs, but would not be eligible for prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;MediaWest*Con was also known as one of the few (possibly only) fan convention to segregate slash fan videos from other video genres. From their 1997 progress report: &lt;q&gt;Due to complaints last year, any “slash” themed videos will be scheduled separately; as such, they cannot be considered for the general fannish video competition; however, “slash” awards will be considered if there are enough entries to compete.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Source: MediaWest*Con progress report (1997).&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As of 2017, MediaWest*Con’s policy regarding slash vids was still in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;convention-vidshows---part-4-the-life-of-a-lonely-vidder&quot;&gt;Convention Vidshows - Part 4: The Life Of A Lonely Vidder:&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Obtaining feedback for fanvids was extremely difficult for these early vidders.  Distributing copies of songvids on tape was expensive and time consuming as each tape had to be made individually.  Also, each copy that was made put more wear on both the master video tape as well as the VCR.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Vidders were also wary of legal challenges as they were transforming not only images but also music. Vidders rarely advertised their vids, even in fan publications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finally, since early vidders often lacked the ability to add credits or title cards to their works, many fans watched vids and had no idea who had created them, something that greatly hindered feedback and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;aside class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Rainbow Noise, which ran for three issues in the 1993-1994, there were no newsletters or letterzines focused on vidding. In 1999, vidders eventually formed a mailing list devoted to vidding  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vidder_(mailing_list)&quot;&gt;“Vidder”&lt;/a&gt;) and today there is an annual convention held in Chicago called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vividcon&quot;&gt;Vividcon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In spite of these obstacles, fanvids remained popular and convention attendees would track down the creators and beg for copies of their fanvids. Those who could not attend conventions would hear about vids, and then want to see them, often made difficult due to the fact that many vidders used &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Pseudonym&quot;&gt;pseudonyms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving many fans in the dark regarding whom to write to.  To meet this demand, Kandy Fong started creating and selling &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Contape&quot;&gt;contapes&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s. A “contape” was a tape that copied all the vids that had been shown at the convention onto a single tape, which then could be sold, to convention attendees and non-attendees alike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Still, even with this improved distribution, vidders often had to rely on friends who attended conventions to report back on their vid’s reception. Of course, if vidders attended an event in person, they had the opportunity to be in the audience when the vid was played.  And the audiences were not always kind:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One vidder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Flamingo&quot;&gt;Flamingo&lt;/a&gt;, remembers:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long oral&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My first vid was so bad, I showed it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Connexions&quot;&gt;Connexions&lt;/a&gt;, very large audience, maybe two hundred, two hundred fifty people…  And they laughed at all the wrong places. There was nothing funny about the vid; it was a drama vid, and they laughed all the way through it. It was just a nightmare…. …It got to the point where I could not be in the room when I showed my vids. It just was too difficult, after spending, you know, days and weeks and hours working on this vid, and to have people say, “Oh god, you picked that song?” And I had somebody say that, out loud, as the first few bars of my song started to play…..&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;..[The] audience can be incredibly rude. And nobody would ever scold them about it, either. It’s like, which is why whenever I do a vidshow, the first thing I say is, you know, “Respect the vidder. Even the worst vid we’re showing has taken dozens and dozens of hours to do, and a tremendous amount of labor. And you’re going to hear the same songs, you’re going to see the same clips; have some respect for the work that it involves.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source: Media Fandom Oral History Project Interview with Flamingo (2013)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To be fair, the audience had little time to react to vids in a thoughtful manner. The vids were shown once, live, sometimes over long two-hour blocks. The audience’s response often had nothing to do with the quality of the vid itself. Popular fandoms would be greeted with cheers, less popular or unknown fandoms generated a muted response.  If a vidder had selected a popular fandom, the audience might be overwhelmed or bored when the vid finally appeared.  Where a fan’s vid was placed in the show could also make a difference. The sound and video could vary for the first few vids as organizers struggled with finicky VCRs that threw off unexpected tracking errors and TV speakers that cut in and out due to the inconsistent quality of thrice copied videotape.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One vidder from the 1990s remembers the watching one of her early vids at a convention:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Escapade&quot;&gt;Escapade&lt;/a&gt; and a few hours before the show, a friend slammed my hand inside a car door. I refused to go to the ER because I really wanted to see my vid live in front of an audience. Luckily nothing was broken, so I sat through the show with my hand buried in a hotel room ice bucket. When my vid came onto the screen I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Gayle_F&quot;&gt;Gayle F&lt;/a&gt;, an experienced and well respected vidder, reaching out to pat my arm in solidarity and understanding. I was both terrified and excited. Watching my vid and hearing the audience reaction was the biggest rush in my life. It felt like performance art on stage. I was hooked.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Morgan_Dawn&quot;&gt;Morgan Dawn’s&lt;/a&gt; personal recollections, used with permission.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because fans reactions to fanvids was based on their familiarity and fondness with the song and as well as a particular TV show, the feedback that vidders did receive was often felt wanting. Vidders lacked the language to communicate with one another and their audience lacked the language to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Borrowing terms from film editing helped, but because vidding pre-dated MTV music videos, fanvids’ shorter clips, lack of dialog and use of music to underscore visuals was not part of the typical moviegoer’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, as vids obtained better sources and more vidders were able to afford VCRs, a few fans decided to take matters in their own hands.  They started hosting panels designed to discuss the content of the vids, stepping away from the purely instructional panels based on the mechanics of how to make a vid with two VCRs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1997, Sandy Herrold and Tashery Shannon held a Sunday morning “Songvid Critique” &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Panel&quot;&gt;panels&lt;/a&gt; at Escapade, a vidding con. This panel had the description: “An exploration of different elements of media vids, with an emphasis on aesthetics. We’ll look at segments of different songs to see how the images were used in conjunction with the varied rhythms of the music, and to enhance the mood.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next year, the Sunday morning panel was billed as a “Music Video Show Review,” using the word “review” for the first time; the panel was held in two parts and was led by Gayle F and Sandy.  In 1999, the panel was billed as “Sunday Morning Vid Review” and was led by Jessica aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Tzikeh&quot;&gt;tzikeh&lt;/a&gt; and Sandy. In 2000, it was framed as “Songvid Appreciation 101” which explicitly claimed to be using the vids from the previous night’s show to illustrate these ideas in a vid. In 2001, Sandy and Rache together hosted: “Songvid Appreciation Escapade style”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Their initial idea for Vid Review was simple: on Sunday morning, after the Saturday evening vidshow, fans would gather to discuss each vid one by one. The focus would be on what fans liked, what fans didn’t like, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over time, a vocabulary emerged to describe why viewer reactions varied. Through these formal Vid Reviews, the vidding community gained a greater understanding that the vid audience was not only made up of fans from different fandoms, but fans of different types of music, along with fans who watch TV and movies in different ways. It also illustrated that some fans absorb meaning from music and others seek visual meaning. It showed that a fan that was exposed to fanvids for the first time may have difficulty understanding a context-based fanvid (a vid that relies on the content of the clip to underscore its meaning). Fans new to vids might gravitate towards more literal pairings of song lyrics with images (“If the singer says: “My heart is on fire,” there’d better be flames” is how one vidder described it.). Fans who are deeply into one show and have memorized the episodes can pick up subtler nuances and ironic juxtapositions. As Rache explained; some viewers ‘read’ fanvids at the kindergarten level and some read fans vids at a college level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Other aspects of fanvids came into focus: the difference between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Con_Vid&quot;&gt;con vid&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Living_Room_Vid&quot;&gt;living room vid&lt;/a&gt;, how the choice of color could influence mood, and how pacing and variation in cuts either build or lose tension. Vidders were advised to pay attention to a song’s “stress points” and to match the action in the vid to those stress points (track either the climactic music or the quieter moments). More and more vidders began talking about “cutting on the beat” which in turn helped viewers understand why a vid worked for them when it did just that. There was greater attention on establishing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/POV&quot;&gt;POV&lt;/a&gt; early on in the vid (when the singer says “I” or “me” the clip should focus on the character who is the POV character or the one telling the story). Changing POV multiple times could be confusing and this could translate into losing viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Law of the Diminishing Audiences was more openly discussed:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With every vid, you start with an unlimited potential vidding audience. With every vidding choice you peel away viewers. You decide to do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_X-Files&quot;&gt;X-Files &lt;/a&gt; vid and you lose 20% of the audience who has never watched X-Files and never will. You then choose to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mulder/Scully&quot;&gt;Mulder/Scully &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Het&quot;&gt;het&lt;/a&gt; vid - whoops, there goes another 25% of your audience who is only there to see slash vids. Now you’re down to 50%. You pick a country western song and suddenly you’re down to the last 5%. And that is before you’ve even made a single edit. Once you understand, as a vidder, that each decision leads you down the path to a different audience, you can understand why &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; audience didn’t “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Grok&quot;&gt;grok&lt;/a&gt;” your vid. Or why &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; audience began wildly cheering and dancing in the aisles. It is not you. It is not them. It is not the vid. It is the meeting of all three - or, as in some cases, the missing of all three that explains a vid’s overall reception. &lt;cite&gt;Source: Morgan Dawn’s personal notes, used with permission, posted to Fanlore.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Other experiments followed. In the late 1990s, vid &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Feedback&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; forms were handed out to vidshow attendees at the Escapade and ZebraCon conventions. The comment sheets asked the audience to offer their thoughts on each vid as they watched. The show paused for a short time after each vid to give fans a chance to write down their quick comments. After the vidshow, the forms would then be cut into sections allowing vidders to take their comments home. However, before this happened, vidders would gather around a table containing the forms immediately after the end of the vid to read their feedback (sometimes aloud) and marvel at both the perspicacity and obtuseness of their vid audience. The idea, which originated with Sandy Herrold and Rache was eventually abandoned in the early 2000s. Some vidders felt that the feedback received was often superficial. Some audience members found it too distracting to watch the vids and write feedback in a 4-5 minute span in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But while the original formal project was discontinued, the conversations and the experiences had furthered interest in the areas of vocabulary and concepts, giving both vid creators and audience members increased appreciation and abilities to talk about vidding with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;That year, one vidder speed-wrote the comments on paper in order to hand carry to them to a co-creator who could not attend the convention. On the left is the joint vid they made: &quot;EP&quot; for the movie &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_English_Patient&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The English Patient&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; starring Ralph Fiennes. On the right is a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Due_South&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;due South&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; vid (&quot;DS&quot;). At the top are the rough breakdowns listed on the feedback form: For &lt;i&gt;The English Patient&lt;/i&gt; vid: 7 people thought it was &quot;Cool&quot;. 8 people thought it was &quot;Decent&quot;. And 5 people said the vid &quot;Didn't Grab Me.&quot; For the &lt;i&gt;due South&lt;/i&gt; vid, a popular TV fandom: 11 people thought it was &quot;Cool&quot;. 6 people thought it was &quot;Decent&quot;. And 3 people said the vid &quot;Didnt Grab Me.&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Comments ranged from the thoughtful: &lt;q&gt;Unexpected. I thought they might ruin my fav movie but it was fascinating. The movie in a microcosm of a song&lt;/q&gt;fire to simple &lt;q&gt;Too long&lt;/q&gt; to sarcastic: &lt;q&gt;Now I can be hideously depressed w/out seeing the movie.&lt;/q&gt; The &lt;i&gt;due South &lt;/i&gt;vid fared better: &lt;q&gt;One of the best in show. POV shifs are unusual but work well.&lt;/q&gt; Of course not everyone agreed: &lt;q&gt;Decent. Song drove me nuts in this context, tho I prob would like it otherwise. Or maybe vid too long.&lt;/q&gt; The song was Sarah McLaughlin so the viewer may be forgiven!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Many vids were made to recruit fans to watch a movie or show. For &lt;i&gt;The English Patient&lt;/i&gt; movie one fan wrote: &lt;q&gt;Very interesting. Have not seen the movie but I will see it now.&lt;/q&gt; For the&lt;i&gt; due South&lt;/i&gt; vid: &lt;q&gt;Liked the video - makes me want to get the episodes.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Other comments made less sense, possibly due to rushed nature of scribbling feedback in the dark. &lt;i&gt;The English Patient&lt;/i&gt; vid used an instrumental piece of music which prompted one fan to write: &lt;q&gt;I prefer words that tell a story.&lt;/q&gt; Below it another fan had a different opinion: &lt;q&gt;Great music which matched the mood perfectly.&lt;/q&gt; But for most fans who had an intense connection to their favorite TV shows, like&lt;i&gt; due South, &lt;/i&gt;a vid could recreate that emotional journey: &lt;q&gt;I cried. This was devastating. I loved the show. I've been in mourning&amp;amp; for weeks [after the show stopped airing]. What an eulogy.&quot;&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given the costs of video editing equipment, it is hard to say how many fans were making fanvids in the US in the early 1980s. We do know that shortly after Kendra Hunter and Diana Barbour made their vids, other groups of women began vidding. Two of these collaborations were &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Three_Sisters&quot;&gt;Three Sisters&lt;/a&gt; (Donna Williams, Linda Brandt and Lucy Keifer) and a group made up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Carol_Huffman&quot;&gt;Carol Huffman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Terry_Martin&quot;&gt;Terry Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Elaine_Hauptman&quot;&gt;Elaine Hauptman&lt;/a&gt;. Between them, they released two more &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Songtape_Collection&quot;&gt;songtapes&lt;/a&gt;: one in 1983 called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Texas_Tape&quot;&gt;The Texas Tape&lt;/a&gt;” (twenty-three vids) and one a few years later called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Dialogue_%26_Songtape&quot;&gt;Dialogue &amp;amp; Songtape&lt;/a&gt;”.  Another development in the late-1980s: Kandy Fong bought a Betamax VCR and switched from slideshows to live action video editing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An informal survey of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/VCR_Vidding&quot;&gt;fanvids made in the VCR era&lt;/a&gt; during the 1980s and 1990s on Fanlore shows well over 1200 titles with over 160 vidders. This list is not representative because large conventions like MediaWest*Con failed to track their vidshow entries and sometimes even their own contest winners. Other conventions did not have contests, opting for straight-up vidshows instead.  And most of these conventions, like ZebraCon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Eclecticon_(New_Jersey)&quot;&gt;Eclecticon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mountain_Media_Con&quot;&gt;Mountain Media Con&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Virgule_Convention&quot;&gt;Virgule,&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Koon-ut-Cali-Con&quot;&gt;Koon-ut-Cali-Con,&lt;/a&gt;, and IDICon are no longer operational.  If any records were kept, they have been lost to time. Finally, even when the vids themselves have survived, they lack &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Title_Card&quot;&gt;title cards&lt;/a&gt; or the names of the contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was not until the 1990s, when vidders gathered at Escapade that extensive cross-pollination began. Escapade saw the creation of the vid review panel, vid feedback forms, and at those panels and reviews vidders started to develop their own vocabulary about how to construct a fanvid. Between 1992 and 2000, over 50 vidders submitted their fanvids to Escapade. Many of those attendees went on to support the creation of Vividcon, the first fan-run convention devoted solely to the art of “vidding”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even without reliable data, it is clear from the info that survives that VCR era vidders were inter-connected and relied on one another extensively. This collaboration - both for financial and creative reasons - was key to the advancement of the artform.  Most fans learned through the mentoring of others and to rely on their community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One fan remembers:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Mary Van Duesen, who was a big, famous, important vidder on the East Coast, she used to, she was very generous with her time with people who were interested in vids and she would, you know, tell them about how to make vids, and sometimes have like little tutorials in her room at cons. And she invited me up to her house for one weekend, to see how she made a vid, and actually I’m credited on that vid. Although you know she totally made it, and I said, “Maybe that scene?” [laughter]… She was very generous with her time and expertise. Cause I would say, because now there are all these theories of mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anybody was my mentor, she was my mentor.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Media_Fandom_Oral_History_Project_Interview_with_Judy_Chien&quot;&gt;Media Fandom Oral Hstory Project Interview with Judy Chien&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These fanvids and the collaborations that produced them were labors of love by and for women. In 1983, a fan wrote about her experiences at ZebraCon #3:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The con was underway. Rooms filled with laughter and cigarette smoke. Wine flowed with love. Zines and stories and song tapes took our time… a song tape was born. The reward was given this year as we watch the results of your hours of hard work. ‘What I Did for Love.’ ‘Another One Bits the Dust.’ ‘Just to Feel this Love.’ ‘Forget Your Troubles, C’mon Get Happy.’… Give yourself a hand, Ladies. Your work deserves more.” &lt;cite&gt;Source: S&amp;amp;H #28 (Dec. 1981)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So working with fragile tapes, no fades/dissolves, 3rd generation quality videotape, a lack of audio editing, rollback erasing video, rainbow noise artifacts, machines that required manual starting and stopping, stopwatches, daunting economic costs, and fighting Macrovision as well as other hurdles imposed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Powers_That_Be&quot;&gt;TPTB&lt;/a&gt;, fans persevered and created a new artform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1990, the vidding collective known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/California_Crew&quot;&gt;California Crew &lt;/a&gt; made a documentary-style video of them editing a fanvid together over a long weekend. The vid was called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Pressure&quot;&gt;Pressure&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[It]….is composed of original footage, depicts the vidders getting together to make a Quantum Leap VCR vid over the course of a single weekend (a highly stressful event, hence the vid’s title.)Pressure is thus a rare artifact in that it documents the complexities of making of a VCR vid. The vidders time the song with a stopwatch, mark out the beats, watch, select, and measure all their clips in advance. The vidders work most of the vid out on yellow legal pads with calculators before actually assembling the clips on tape, laying them down in order. The audio track was imported last. The vid also documents other aspects of fannish subculture circa 1990: in the frame we see numerous cases of VHS cassettes and piles of fan fiction zines. &lt;cite&gt;Source:  Fanlore: “Pressure”&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Leave this Show</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;open&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lolachrome’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://archiveofourown.org/works/480121&quot;&gt;You&lt;/a&gt;” is about much more than Kurt Hummel from Glee. It’s about movies, magic, queerness, and longing, but mostly it’s a vid about the pain and the ecstasy of being who you are, when you are. But bear with me for a minute while I get us situated: In order to write properly about Chris Colfer’s intriguing face intercut with Golden Age Hollywood movies in a symbolic manner, I must first gripe about my show.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For several years, 2011-2016 more or less, when introducing myself at a fannish meet-up and being asked about my current interests, I answered, “Glee…God help me.” Within broader media fandom, Glee doesn’t exactly have a reputation as a pinnacle of art and good taste. Admitting I watched it conferred no dignity upon me. Plenty of us have been there, falling for some compelling detail of an otherwise frustrating show, and, to their credit, my friends were mostly sympathetic, and listened to me babble about aesthetics and queerness and sound design with great patience. When I first mentioned it on my blog, and tried to explain what on earth had allured me, I described it thus:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hours and hours of headdesking interrupted by fleeting moments of transcendent, culture-defining genius. It is—90% of the time—not a show about the way things are, not realism; it’s a show about the way things feel. It’s loud, technicolour, ecstatic, mortifying, and deeply stupid. It is a show about self-absorption: every little humiliation is epic, and every triumph is also vindication. It’s not a very nice show, mostly. But every once in a while it shoves itself aside, and is surprised to find it was sitting on a kernel of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The truth frequently found itself lodged in the throat of Kurt Hummel, the gay boy named after a porcelain figurine and a Sound of Music character, played with guts and subtlety by Colfer. In 2009, Glee was one of the first major-network shows to give a gay teenager a starring role. Kurt began as a small, effeminate stereotype, and over six years became an icon—-not a supporting character, or comic relief or a tragic example, but a full-blown goddamned Campbellian hero with a front page, A-plot romance. When the show got dreadful (and it was always swinging wildly toward dreadful on some axis or other), it was Kurt for whom I stayed. Kurt and his boyfriend, Blaine, individually and as a pair.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kitschy old Glee, viewed through my Kurt-coloured glasses, is a show about queer identity, restlessness, and nostalgia. Despite the autotuned pop sensibility that critics love to bash, it’s riddled with obscure movie and musical references as well as extended tributes to artists and artworks its teenaged target audience had almost no familiarity with and no investment in—from Judy Garland Christmas specials to recreations of Wham! videos from the eighties. Sometimes these tributes stem from a deeply sincere desire to bring the best of American pop culture history to the attention of the next generation. Other song choices seem purely self-indulgent on showrunner Ryan Murphy’s part, winking at an audience of a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;slider&quot; style=&quot;height:480px&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;juxtapose&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=796bdcb8-eef9-11e6-8b75-0edaf8f81e27&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lola’s vid, archly titled “You,” reflects the same ambivalence toward Glee and Ryan Murphy’s masturbatory nostalgia. At first glance, it’s a character study of Kurt that makes thoughtful use of old movie footage to deepen its argument. It’s also a study of Kurt’s own use of vintage texts and personalities to make sense of his position in the world. On a third level, “You” is a grumpy dig at Murphy himself, and the constraints Glee’s sloppy, Prime Time structure places on a character whose narrative potential grew far greater than the imaginations of his writers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/33934630&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lola’s song choice is “Sort Of” by Ingrid Michaelson. It’s about a couple in an unequal relationship. The singer is too intense and too invested in a lover who doesn’t reciprocate her feelings. The lyrics, read as a single, coherent arc, are not a perfect, literal match for the vid’s thesis, but rather shift in implication from clip to clip, verse to verse. And though Kurt’s boyfriend has an important role to play, Lola’s primary interest isn’t shipping. Michaelson’s refrain goes, “My love’s too big for you, my love.” Lola’s “you” isn’t Blaine, though, but—well. Kurt is a gay boy in a small town. It doesn’t matter who or what is the object; Kurt loves many things. His love is always already too frightening and too big.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;invert pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to go in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just one other sound sample shows up early on. “We have to go in there.” Lola’s thesis unfolds with those words, spoken by Kurt as he and Rachel, his best friend and best rival, stand outside Tiffany’s on their first trip to Manhattan. Footage from Breakfast at Tiffany’s intercuts with scenes from the two friends’ pilgrimage to the famous store(/story) as well as the Gershwin Theater, the home of the musical Wicked. As they sneak onto the stage, an overlaid film reel effect alerts us to Lola’s intentions: Kurt wants to be inside the story. Furthermore, we as viewers must be aware of the stacking of narratives: Kurt is already inside the story we are watching. The constraints under which Kurt struggles are inflicted not purely by his fellow characters in oppressive, small-town Ohio, but by the producers and writers’ room of a Hollywood studio who don’t always know what to do with him or how to leap past the clichéd Gay Storylines they were raised on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For Kurt, the allure of Old Hollywood is poignant. He doesn’t fit in his mean little town surrounded by cow pastures; his spirit is too big, his dreams too bright, his sense of romance unsatisfied. And he’s too queer. Small and effeminate at age fifteen, with a soaring countertenor voice perfectly suited to diva songs such as “Defying Gravity” and “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” Kurt belongs anywhere but here. In the glee club, he finds companionship—other kids who care too much, his fellow misfits and anachronisms—but his choir director overlooks him for solo parts and won’t let him sing the girl songs that suit his strengths, and he’s bullied as soon as he leaves the music room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;aside&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/giphy-mirror-glitch.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kurt has no gay mentors. He has a handful of clichéd and dismal Gay Storylines to pour over. Role models are scarce; he’s all but cut off from the queer history that should be his right. And so he swaps in women’s history, and, abandoned by his own era, turns to the past for solidarity—to the dreamers and lovers of Golden Age cinema. Here’s Holly Golightly, small-town girl in the big city, and plucky farmer-turned-thespian Jane Falbury, and Kathy Selden from Singin’ in the Rain being led onto a Paramount soundstage—being let in—in a movie about movie magic. These are the allies of his imagination: boxed in by heterosexual patriarchy and yearning for freedom and a kindred spirit to share it. In them, and in the divas whose songs he sings, Kurt finds strength and self-definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;splash&quot; id=&quot;tiffany&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;splashquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his spirit is too &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 his dreams too &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I owe part of my argument to a set of essays on Glee’s position in American musical history by Allison McCracken. “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2011/05/03/glee-the-countertenor-and-the-crooner/&quot;&gt;The Countertenor and the Crooner&lt;/a&gt;” had a huge impact on Glee fandom in 2011, and Lola mentions it as inspiration in her vid notes. According to McCracken,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;long&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Defying Gravity” began Glee’s practice of having Kurt reinterpret selections from the gay-fan canon of female diva performances, most of them from Hollywood or Broadway. While these songs are tributes to the singers, as well as an education in the history of gay sensibility, they are also an indicator that the torch is being passed. While the gay boy will surely continue to identify with (and sing along to) female singers, Kurt asserts that he can be his own diva, singing solos in traditionally female vocal ranges; Kurt performs “Le Jazz Hot” from Victor/Victoria because it allows him to “embrace my male and my female sides.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But Kurt’s relationship with his chosen people is complicated. Judy Garland and Debbie Reynolds aren’t Kurt’s only cinematic soulmates according to Lola; James Dean also shows up in his role as Jim Stark in Rebel without a Cause. Lola uses Jim’s red jacket to draw out the connection between Jim and Kurt. When Jim gives the object to his friend Plato, who holds it tenderly and reverently, he is also offering his legacy to Kurt. Kurt, wearing his copy of the jacket like armour, bears a stunning resemblance to the queer icon. But it’s a bleak moment, too, for Kurt is singing for his sick father, and in the next clip he is a child at his mother’s funeral. Linking the only queer man in Lola’s list of idols, a man who died at age twenty-four, with Kurt’s own experiences with death, emphasizes the loneliness and precariousness of his position. In the last clip of Dean, he’s white as a ghost in his T-shirt, and Plato/Kurt, following in his footsteps and looking hopelessly young, gazes after him longingly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the real world, Kurt doesn’t yet have James Dean’s charisma or ability to hold his own in a skirmish. Lola shows footage of his alienation from his peers, his run-ins with the school bully, and the inane, useless reaction of his teacher, over the lyrics, “And if I were stronger, I’d leave this show / And if I were stronger, I’d up and go.” Like a Sondheim character, he feels in his bones that he’s been trapped in the wrong story.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/kurtlikes.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then, jarringly, Lady Gaga! Dressed as Kurt’s goddess-muse and seated on the throne from her “Born This Way” music video, she heralds a shift in the narrative. In verse three, Blaine, Kurt’s boyfriend, finally makes his appearance. “You’re not alone,” Lady Gaga seems to say. “Look, I will give you a companion.” And here he is, bright-eyed, exuberant, with charisma bursting from him like sunlight, and beaming right at Kurt. But Michaelson sings: “Baby you’ve got the sort of eyes that tell me tales / That your sort of mouth just will not say (the truth impales) / That you don’t need me, but you won’t leave me.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Blaine is yet another ambiguous presence in Kurt’s life, a source of love and hurt inextricably linked. With the voice and body of a matinee idol, effortlessly, classically masculine, Blaine breezes into the role of leading man in Kurt’s life…and in all the musical auditions in Kurt’s life. Lola intercuts footage of Blaine’s flawless Tony audition with Kurt essaying Romeo and being laughed off the stage. Blaine is gay, just like Kurt, but, in his affect, he’s the right kind of gay.  Everyone desires him. He steals spotlights from Kurt without even trying, or wanting to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;blaine&quot;&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not evident in “You” is the fact that Blaine’s gender presentation is as complex as Kurt’s. Starting in season three, and gaining clarity after Lola’s vid was finished, it became clear that Blaine is the boy with the Tony-from-West-Side-Story stage charisma, but in life his soft sweetness runs even deeper than Kurt’s. In Glee’s narrative, he is pursued as often as he pursues; he enjoys as many feminine pastimes as Kurt, from sewing to scrapbooking, and he covers as many songs by female artists as his boyfriend, albeit transposed for his smooth tenor. His emotions lie closer to the surface. “He wasn’t afraid of intimacy,” Kurt says about him in season six. And he gets away with it all unscathed, as Kurt does not, mostly by virtue of being handsome.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;sidequote right invert&quot;&gt;Blaine can leave the show that Kurt is trapped in&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lola illustrates this tension between public acceptability and private passion with the order of her clips. We see Blaine first in his masculine prep school blazer, then on stage, charming the hell out of an audition panel, then as played by Gene Kelly, dancing with another man—but sexlessly, please and thank you—in Singin’ in the Rain. Kathy/Kurt gazes up at the billboard of the seemingly unattainable Don/Blaine, seduced in spite of her/himself. Only then do we see Blaine in private, lying nose to nose with Kurt, the picture of romantic tenderness. The contrast is uneasy. Kurt loves Blaine sincerely, and Blaine loves him back just as much, but his presence in this vid is about what happens when what you love is what wounds you. Blaine can leave the show that Kurt is trapped in; there is a place for Blaine in any show he wants. Despite their best efforts, this background radiation poisons their partnership by increments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There’s no happy ending for Kurt within the scope of the vid. Kurt fails to make the cut for the New York drama school of his dreams. He watches Rachel board the train, and Judy stares through the bars at the station, and Judy sings “Over the Rainbow” from a farmstead in Kansas. Lola gives us one last whirl of clips: Kurt and Blaine stuffed into the roles of “best friends and holiday roommates” in their school Christmas tribute to Judy Garland, Fred Astaire manipulating Ginger Rogers across the dance floor, Audrey Hepburn alone and yearning. “Here I go again,” sings Michaelson as Kurt stands in front of the Glee club for the hundredth time, right where he started, but still upright, still singing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/ending/1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/ending/2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;column image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/ending/3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This ending is not the end of Kurt’s story. “You” really should be the first of a diptych. Post-Glee season three, Kurt moves to New York and gets into his school. His body matures, his baby fat melts away, and he trades in his “fashion has no gender” aesthetic for lean, sharp menswear. His romanticism is tempered by the ups and downs of his love life. As Kurt grows into himself in a city full of artists and role models of every gender and orientation, his identification with the feminine transmutes and fades. He sings men’s songs—”Being Alive” and “Bring Him Home” replace “Defying Gravity” and “Rose’s Turn”—and schoolmates start comparing him to Paul Newman instead of Minnie Mouse. Though he still experiences homophobia and effemiphobia, he’s a tougher act. Whether this change is positive, neutral, or negative is a subject for different essay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOrftVRg4r0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Outwardly and inwardly, Kurt grows up, but clues about his enduring relationship with an idealized past lurk in his fantasies. In a lush dream sequence from season four, while he and Blaine are broken up, he is Satine from Moulin Rouge to Blaine’s Christian: one more time, Kurt inserts himself into a movie about a simpler time. By this point, Kurt and Blaine have sung many male/female duets with Kurt taking the female part and Blaine as his dashing hero. This time, the sequence is about Kurt’s melancholy recognition of the unsustainability of those simple roles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2xN1oUiGoQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;aside&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pics/posts/show/fig3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Fig. 3: The evolution of Kurt’s personal style.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And then there’s his last solo on the show, which Colfer himself chose: “Memory,” from the musical Cats. It’s the ultimate female diva song, sung by a sort of feline Norma Desmond, aging star of Hollywood’s lost golden era. It’s also too high for Colfer’s adult voice; he sounds shrill and thin. He doesn’t fit this song any more than he fits into the mold of the starlets he idolized. And he sings it while auditioning for Peter Pan. As an adult, Kurt is in the process of learning to change the shape and purpose of his nostalgia. In his musical choices, his tumultuous but enduring relationship with his boyfriend, even his wardrobe, which he takes very seriously as a reflection of his inner self, he takes what’s good about the past and restyles it for his own use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“So what are you into these days?” “Glee, God help me,” says Kurt Hummel. Stuck in a genre that doesn’t serve him, Kurt finds meaning and pleasure in his own meticulously curated set of stories: he’s a little bit fannish, really.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;sidequote left&quot;&gt;making everything better in your own version&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Leaving the show” is what we, as fan creators and consumers of fic, art, vids, etc., make our characters do all the time. Fan work, at its best, is about illuminating facets of beloved characters that the canon keeps in shadow, or exploring which parts of them stay constant even when the narrative or setting changes. It’s also about fleeing from frustrating storylines and making everything better in your own version. Like Kurt, we Mary Sue ourselves into other times and places, and interpret our lives through beloved texts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“You” is an important example of a vidding style not common in Glee fandom, and maybe increasingly rare in vidding at large, as new generations of vidders grow more dispersed and self-taught: the meta vid, which develops a single critical argument via carefully chosen symbolism. Lola’s use of multiple sources to deepen a study of a single character is a technique I want to see more of. Our ability to draw connections between eras, narrative genres, and diverse and seemingly unrelated character types widens our reach and enriches us as storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

        <title>Scream</title>
        <description>&lt;section id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was somewhat paralyzed by choice for this essay, because there are so many wonderful vids I want to go on at length about. (It’s…a thing I do. Never ask me about vids in person. Never ask me about anything in person.) In the end, I picked this one because it amazes me, because I have a lot to say about it, and because it’s been relevant to my life lately. (Spoiler: I am not a companion and have not gone for a ride in the TARDIS. Just in case you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So, here we go. Four reasons why I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://archiveofourown.org/works/933648&quot;&gt;Scream&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laurasha.com/vids/&quot;&gt;Laura Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; and Kass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;video fullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;invert&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;one-helpful-life-lessons-for-prospective-time-travelers&quot;&gt;One: Helpful Life Lessons for Prospective Time Travelers&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To me, this vid is about – well, a couple of things, but most of all it’s about the companion cycle. The Doctor, he likes himself some companionship, and he’s got his routine for getting it down pat. (He is, as the vid description says, the ultimate pick-up artist.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;We all fall a little bit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;His first step is to dazzle them – promise them everything, show them how amazing the universe really is. And that’s the entire first section of this vid. The Doctor sees someone special and shows them something special. Every companion gets seduced the same way; the parallels in the early clips are so pointed, so clear. (And that, to me, is the first glimpse of the sharp, sharp edge that is still mostly hidden in the first part of the vid, because – yes, the Doctor thinks you are so, so special, companions. Just like he did all the others.) And we understand it, is the thing; this vid puts us perfectly in the companions’ shoes. If there’s a better pick-up line than, “I have an actual time machine, do you want to ride in?” I am not sure what it is. (Even forewarned,  I’d guaranteed fall for that, so guaranteed that I just made “someone with an actual working time machine” an official permitted exception in my marriage. My wife’s response: “I thought that was already a given, because…you.” Ah, marriage.) So it’s no surprise every companion falls hard, the same way, every time. We all fall a little bit. Because it is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Doctor’s next step – and I don’t think he does it on purpose, at all, but the pattern is clear – is to destroy them. The companion cycle, uh – it isn’t a love story. The second part of the vid shows what happens once you fall for the Doctor: delight and seduction are rapidly followed by complication, destruction, and discard (if there’s even anything left to discard).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Starting at around &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=1m25s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;, we get to watch the companions scream in terror, have their literal voices taken away (around &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=2m20s&quot;&gt;2:22&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the vid that wins my personal Most Horrifying award), and fall apart. And fall, and fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o?start=90&amp;amp;end=146&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And then the vid takes us back around to the start, with a brand-new companion. We get to see her shining delight, her wonder, the start of her adventure – but now we know what’s coming. And she doesn’t. It’s the creepiest part of the whole thing. I love how this vid takes all these fun, cute, sweet moments, and overlays them with horror, because, uh, maybe the Doctor didn’t mention this to you, lady, but – he isn’t a &lt;em&gt;tame&lt;/em&gt; Time Lord. And you aren’t going to come out of this with a bunch of funny stories to tell the grandkids. Hope you’re ready to go all night, Clara!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You won’t get to see the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Basically, this vid is here to teach us all that the most successful survival strategy in the Doctor Who universe is: if you see the Doctor, kick him hard in both shins and then run away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I know, I know, this is very the first day of Vidding 101: An Introduction to Vid Reviews for Non-Majors, but the song choice makes this vid. Or maybe this vid makes the song. Not sure which.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;sidequote right invert&quot;&gt;this vid unpacks the song&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This vid unpacks the song, slices off its cheesy, hey-baby-can-I-buy-you-an-orgasm surface to expose a seamy underbelly of horror. Honestly, I no longer have any idea if that underbelly of horror exists in the song when it stands alone; like all great vids, this one looped back into my interpretation of the song. They’re married forever in my head, now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s…probably not the happiest marriage, gotta say.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o?start=11&amp;amp;end=22&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we start with the literal fireworks on “thinking ‘bout what I’d do to that body” (around &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=11s&quot;&gt;0:12&lt;/a&gt;), because sometimes subtlety is overrated, and we go all the way to the most flesh-crawling interpretations of “one life, just live it” and “I wanna take off all your clothes and put something on you” ever (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=1m50s&quot;&gt;1:50&lt;/a&gt;-2:10ish). And in between and all around, we have every interpretation of “Oooh baby baby” you can possibly want. It’s a thing of beauty and terror forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o?start=110&amp;amp;end=130&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I love how this video does for the song exactly what it does for Doctor Who: rips it to pieces and shows you the creepy, horrifying seams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;splash&quot; id=&quot;dick&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;splashquote&quot;&gt;dick jokes must fall&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;three-every-vid-needs-a-dick-joke&quot;&gt;Three: Every Vid Needs a Dick Joke&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Into every vid of slowly spiraling creepiness, a few dick jokes must fall. Or, okay, no, probably not, but one of the things I love about this vid is how certain clips still make me laugh. The vidders are not at all going to shy away from the literal interpretation of this song, no – they’ve thrown in a few thrusting phallic objects (check out 0:50-1:05, for example) and literally explosive orgasms (like at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=1m14s&quot;&gt;1:14&lt;/a&gt;), for every viewer who ever read an overblown sex scene and giggled a little. (I really hope that’s all of us.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o?start=50&amp;amp;end=66&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This vid also has great examples of what I think of as beat humor, where the vidders hit the beat in a way that’s so perfect and unexpected it’s actually funny. Like, check out the pulsing Dalek, uh, bits (I don’t know what you call those bits) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qSyadYLCA3o?t=1m35s&quot;&gt;1:35&lt;/a&gt; – it’s so right and so surprising that I smile helplessly every time I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSyadYLCA3o?start=97&amp;amp;end=99&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;sidequote left invert&quot;&gt;a cautionary tale of terror&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What I’m saying is, “Scream” has moments of emotional contrast, like every good story needs to. Sure, it’s mostly a cautionary tale of terror, but you also get to laugh, and I think that actually makes the other emotional beats hit harder, because you relax for just a second and then the vid punches you again, when you’re not expecting it. It’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;splash&quot; id=&quot;companion&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;splashquote&quot;&gt;the companion cycle: excitement, love, disillusionment, sadness, loss&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;four-the-meta-cherry-on-top&quot;&gt;Four: The Meta Cherry on Top&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But none of those first three reasons are why I decided to write an essay about this specific vid. See, I love a vid that gets meta on me, that isn’t just about the canon or the characters, but also, to a certain extent, about my own life, or something in my own life. And this vid, this vid does all of that. And so it has taken on special meaning for me in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;See, my sister is a Doctor Who fan from waaaay back. (I think her One True Doctor is, like, Six?) Her oldest son has been a Doctor Who fan for coming up on a decade, and when he fans, my friends, he does it right, and by “right” I mean “as obsessively as humanly possible.” And all that was true when I first saw this vid. I’d watched my family watch Doctor Who. I’d watched my friends watch Doctor Who. I’d even seen a bit of Doctor Who myself. I thought I knew the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But then my son discovered Doctor Who, and living through his experience of it turned everything up to eleven. First, there was his wide-eyed amazement and delight – so many cool concepts! Oh my god a TARDIS you can TRAVEL THROUGH TIME that is the BEST THING IN THE WORLD! And then he still loved it, but he had some disturbing unanswered questions (“But why do so many people die? Why can’t the Doctor save everyone?” “Why does she have to lose her memory? Why does she have to go to jail just because the Doctor is mad at her?”). And then, eventually, he started backing slowly away. Twelve broke him. He couldn’t take the Doctor, and he especially couldn’t take what happened to Clara. His wide eyes didn’t mean wonder anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Basically, my son went through the viewer’s version of the companion cycle: excitement, love, disillusionment, sadness, loss. And watching him do that made me get “Scream” on a level I hadn’t before, made me understand how sad it is, as well as how horrifying. Because really this vid is about loving something that is going to hurt you. And that’s the Doctor, and it’s also the show.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So the thing I love most about this vid is that it isn’t just about the companions, and it isn’t just about the canon. It’s about both the Doctor, this fascinating, extremely imperfect being, and Doctor Who, this fascinating, extremely imperfect show. That we love. That makes us scream. In every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

        <title>Bad Romance</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;open&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to write a story inspired by Bad Romance ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Sisabet&quot;&gt;sisabet&lt;/a&gt; released it, because it is everything I love about Lex and Clark/Lex and Superman vs Lex Luthor, and I keep failing, because it is in fact EVERYTHING I love about them. The thing that this vid does—which vids can do, like poetry and song, in a way that narrative can’t—is tell ALL the stories at the same time, the underlying emotional story. 
I also keep failing to pick out specific clips so you are going to have to watch the whole vid with me once through first and then we can move on together!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So one of the most amazing things Bad Romance does is use the whole sweep of the Superman mythos and all the different canons we have for this story. By doing that, the vid pulls us away from the underlying narrative of any one canon, and that helps it tell this ur-story. I love how right at the opening sisabet starts with literally SUPERFRIENDS and the wacky Legion of Doom headquarters rising out of the swamp, then goes to the lurid Beyond The Grave! comics cover before we get Smallville. Even though the vid leans heavily on Smallville’s Clark/Lex relationship, it isn’t a Smallville vid that uses outside source. Smallville canon is clearly just one of the possible Superman canons here, and that makes the Smallville canon also just one of the possible stories of the Smallville universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When we do get to Smallville source, we start with this awesome horror-movie sequence: the hallway, the Frankensteinian torture flashes, Lex’s bloody hands on the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=16&amp;amp;end=27&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By the time we get to the brief light at the end of that tunnel, the gold and red of Clark interrupting the piano playing, it’s completely clear that we’re not actually inside a single “real” story—we’re inside Lex Luthor’s head, that hallway tunnel is leading us down into the full depths of his obsession, and look, he is REALLY REALLY OBSESSED.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;destruction is not a deterrent&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I also have to talk about the vid description for a second here—sisabet has captioned it as “When mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent” and I love that because when I watch this vid, I always think of watching the computer in Wargames play out all the different scenarios of nuclear war, trying to see if there’s any way to win:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=148&amp;amp;end=281&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bad Romance is Lex playing out every possible scenario of his relationship with Clark, trying to find a way to make it work. And he clearly can’t imagine anything healthy or good or simple for more than a few moments, this is not a vid where we are allowed to imagine him being satisfied with true love or a happy ending—he’s Lex Luthor all the way through, he’s power-hungry and furious and he doesn’t just want Clark to love him, he wants Clark to love him totally: he wants to conquer him, and he wants to conquer the world, and he’s totally unwilling to compromise. 
And Lex Luther is also a genius, so he can see perfectly well that no matter which way he goes, it all ends in flames, but unlike the computer, he will never in a million years end up at the conclusion that the only winning move is not to play. I love how sisabet uses the Lex Luthor: Man of Steel comic, the part where Lex says I have hope—because that’s the fundamental point, he does have hope, he won’t quit trying no matter what. And the whole Beyond The Grave!!! opening is echoed again to emphasize it, not even death is going to stop Lex Luthor, he is going to keep coming:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=194&amp;amp;end=203&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id=&quot;someday&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Someday&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someday, as Lex says in the vid, he’s going to make it. He believes! (And Clark’s death isn’t going to stop him, either!)
And what keeps them both trapped in this bad romance is that Clark is in Lex’s reach. Clark keeps fluttering around Lex like a moth to a flame. I love these repeated sequences where sisabet cuts rapid fire among closeups creating this sense of the two of them circling each other:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;dark slideshow&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;slides&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://j.gifs.com/0gyNGv.gif&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://j.gifs.com/xGNAJ9.gif&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://j.gifs.com/MjmPyA.gif&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In these and throughout the whole vid, we get this amazing nonstop whiplashing movement between the highest moments of love and connection and collaboration and the moments of PURE RAGE and violence. There is no downtime. This is all drama, all high intensity, and ultimately that is what Lex wants the most. Screw friendship! HE JUST WANTS ROMANCE.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;eyes&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for me the core tension in the Superman story is exactly that Superman the character belongs at that high-drama level, but that doesn’t mean Clark wants to be there. A central question in any piece of Superman canon is always who is the actual person, Kal-El or Clark Kent, and where does the canon come down between making him the distant alien who puts on a thin shell of human disguise to walk among us and loves us but is never one of us, and making him the ordinary human being who has to struggle with understanding and using his ludicrous alien powers and trying to stay human while he does.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And here in this vid, Lex is the human being who has sacrificed his humanity so he can operate on that insane high drama level, and he is desperate for Clark to come with him to high drama land! Because who else is he going to hate/love/fight, there’s nobody else out there he considers a worthy opponent. Because Clark does have these unimaginable powers, he can be dragged there and is constantly tempted by it. 
And Lex knows that he’s courting destruction when he tries to pull Clark towards his own dark side, but he doesn’t care. He’s as hungry for the worst of Clark as for the best of him, maybe even more, because that puts Clark on his level and in his reach:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=130&amp;amp;end=146&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of course what makes this all so satisfying is also that the vid also says what fandom says, the vid is our voice too—we don’t want Clark and Lex being “friends,” we want them to go to those intense moments and push them further. The vid is one long howl demanding the climax that the canon refuses to give us—on multiple levels, both because as slash fans we want the romance that they won’t show, and because this is as open-ended as canon gets. Superman is never going to stop. Superman won’t stay dead and Lex Luthor won’t stay dead and so Lex is right to have hope, he can keep coming and keep coming and keep trying to play until he gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;striving for climax&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the most brilliant choices in this vid that helps to build this sense of striving for climax for me is the way sisabet uses the scene of Clark kneeling and giving Lex his hand. First of all, the scene, which in the canon was actually Zod possessing Lex, is beautifully decontextualized—by the time we get to the first appearance of this clip, we’re so firmly situated in Lex’s desires that I don’t think of Zod for a second; I immediately read this as a scene of Clark kneeling before Lex.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But the really spectacular thing is, this clip—which is also visually a pop of bright primary color, a moment of purer fantasy breaking through—gives us this beautiful moment of delayed gratification, because sisabet cuts it up and gives us the setup of it very early in the vid:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=65&amp;amp;end=74&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And then she delays the final payoff moment of the clip until really late in the vid, on the howl of I just want romance:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-Vi70SCrxA?start=264&amp;amp;end=280&amp;amp;version=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;She could have used this as a closing clip or even just on a line that ends a song section, made it feel like a conclusion—but she doesn’t: instead the clip lands in the middle of a section, and so this moment remains Lex’s desire, not reality. He keeps howling for romance, he’s still trying to find a solution, this one or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The actual ending is a furious descent into pure madness, Lex in the Oval Office vision—which from canon we know ends with the whole world dying—and Joker-laughing up into Clark’s face, until we end with Lex coming out of his terrifying hallway, and the door closes behind him, but all the demons are still in there, the simulations are still playing out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

        <title>On The Prowl</title>
        <description>&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;these-are-a-few-of-my-favorite-tropes-hurt-comfort-and-on-the-prowl&quot;&gt;These are a few of my favorite tropes: Hurt-comfort and “On the Prowl”&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of things I love most about media fandom is how it brings to the foreground the collaboration of not only different creators but also the impact of the audiences. After all, before we create fannish material, we consume the media texts—in turn loving and hating them, enjoying and dismissing them, interpreting and analyzing them. Any fan writer is first a reader/viewer, of the source texts but also, often, of other fan works. And any interpretation is, of course, first of all deeply personal, but part of being fannish often means that we share our feelings, and thus responses move from individual to collective reactions. Fandom can be an echo chamber of sorts—the highs are higher and the lows are lower. It also is a community where our emotional responses are shared and valued, where we don’t have to apologize for our kinks and squicks: our voyeuristic desires and narcissistic identifications are welcomed and often shared by other fans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Often when outsiders first discover fandom they are stunned by certain genres and tropes. Male pregnancies, gender swaps, and mind bonds may occur in non-fannish art, but the popularity of these tropes is noteworthy. Even more so is the preponderance of what we call hurt-comfort, the inflicting of emotional or physical hurt on one or all of the protagonists to create an environment where that pain can be remedied via comfort. It’s one of my personal favorites, but looking at archives, it seems widely popular: on the Archive of Our Own, a good 8% of works are tagged by their authors as hurt-comfort and the tag has over 3 million bookmarks. It’s noteworthy enough that the first academic essay on fan fiction, Joanna Russ’s “Pornography By Women For Women, With Love!” (1985) describes it in detail. In her 1992 book-length anthropological study, Enterprising Women, Camille Bacon-Smith dedicates her final chapter to the genre, suggesting that it is the most intimate secret of media fandom; she announces that “at the heart of the [media fan] community something both more meaningful and more dangerous lay hidden” (269)—and she discovers it to be hurt-comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Watching Sisabet and Sweetestdrain’s multivid “On the Prowl” suggests Bacon-Smith might have a point—at least as far as the vidders and many viewers (including myself) are concerned. Created for the “Self Portrait” Challenge for the 2010 VividCon, the vid is an illustration and analysis of certain parts of media fan culture as well as a challenge to all of its fannish viewer. The vid’s tag line in the program and when shared online is the provocative question “Where is our line?” Before we even begin watching, the summary challenges us viewers to consider our own viewing position. Even after watching the vid (once, twice, a dozen times…), the questions may remain unanswered. Did we turn away at the burnt corpse? Did we close our eyes when the fingernail gets pulled? But, most importantly, at what point does pleasure turn to shock turn to embarrassment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;video fullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/M392_kRIxjA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The vid opens on its title card “On the Prowl” over the spoken words “I was thinking about picking up some…” The breathy pause on black is resolved by the words “young boys” with a first image of Taylor Lautner as sexy Twilight werewolf Jacob Black taking off his shirt. This sets up the entire video as an aggressive exploration of female sexuality and the female gaze. Lydia Lunch, the raspy female voice, is an artist who has been a radical voice the alternative scene for decades, doubling down on the predatory age difference implied in the words.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of hurt-comfort in slash fandom (quite often using the characters the vidders depict as suffering in “On the Prowl”) and the fact that the vid is framed as a “Self Portrait,” the vid is clearly by and for hurt-comfort fans. We can read On the Prowl as an investigation, an inquiry into the way many hurt-comfort fans (including clearly the vidder and including me) feel about the suffering they like their beloved protagonists to endure. From the predatory opening to the breathlessly hungry and ultimately horrifying repeated lyric “And then I wanted more,” the fanvid pushes us to (find) our limits. It may begin with bare skin, moving on to bruises without blood, but then it goes further and further and further. The clear progression, the repetition of similar types of abuse and torture, is a portrait of a community that is egging itself on; daring itself and each other to go bigger, to dare more. The video asks each of its viewers where their own lines are and how much hurt they enjoy in their hurt-comfort. Of course there are fans to whom this type of story does not appeal at all. And yet, the thin lines between hurt and sexuality, the doubling of images of severe pain to mimic images of sexual ecstasy can be found in fannish works even outside of hurt-comfort—though they are clearly much more prevalent in that genre.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As the fast, aggressive electronic music start up, we are presented with an array of images of naked men from a variety of sources. Everything in this video is collaborative and transformative: the music is an original by Blow-Up, a DJ duo mostly known for their remixes, featuring the voice of Lydia Lunch. The vid uses clips from over 60 TV shows and films to draw our attention to the popular trope of heroic male suffering. As it stands and without any context, it could easily be misread as what fans often shorthand as “torture porn”—the voyeuristic enjoyment of fictional suffering. It singlemindedly progresses from buff naked men, to men fighting, to men getting bound and beaten and electrocuted and cut and burnt and tortured. For any casual viewer, it may be an indictment of media violence, but to a media fan it is so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For one, we recognize many if not most of the guys and often the context of the clip: Angel coming back from hell in Buffy; Robert Downey Jr. in the boxing ring in Sherlock Holmes; David Tennant’s Doctor Who falling out of an airplane in order to fight the Master; James Bond getting tortured in Casino Royale; Torchwood’s Captain Jack getting cemented alive; Han Solo’s frozen face of agony; Hutch getting kidnapped and addicted to heroin; Captain Picard as the Borg; Sam’s fingernail getting pulled out on Supernatural; to name but a few that resonate with me personally. So the references are meaningful in and of themselves but also, of course, as they showcase a variety of media texts that love to beat up their heroes—and we love watching them get beat up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Sam Winchester&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The vid celebrates the way fan works often turn the gaze back at the men, thus objectifying them, reminiscent of other fanvids such as the Clucking Belles’ “A Fannish Taxonomy of Hotness (Hot Hot Hot!)” (2005). Both vids in fact use the same pattern of offering a series of shots where the heroes do the same thing or are in the same situation, reminding us of the tropes media uses and fans embrace. In “A Fannish Taxonomy of Hotness,” the tropes are varied, ranging from sword fighting and bare-knuckled fights to costume choices (black T-shirts, hats, dresses, straight jackets). But even though it features brief moments of fighting and suffering, the emphasis tends to be on the presentation of male bodies and the tropes that appealingly display them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, “On the Prowl” zooms in on one narrow aspect of fannish desire—albeit an beloved and extremely personal one, the vidders suggest. “On the Prowl” focuses in only on the hurt, the torture, the suffering and only that of the male protagonists. It is these exact canon scenes, of course, that hurt-comfort fans use to jump off into their fan stories. How often does a fist fight between Mulder and Krycek lead the two to discover their underlying feelings? How often does Q help James Bond recover from the PTSD of the sexual torture he endured? There exists an entire subgenre of Starsky&amp;amp;Hutch post-addiction stories, and Angel dealing with hell is not only at the center of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Season 3, but also of any Angel-pairing written at that time. If “A Fannish Taxonomy of Hotness” reminds us that tropes are common and popular and already present in the source texts, “On the Prowl” reminds us that the shows repeatedly ask us to emphasize with (if not enjoy) the visual suffering of the central characters. Watching the progression of suffering invokes for me not only the individual scenes but also the stories that fix them—as well as all the other stories that harm my BSOs even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;video fullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4E7T5klLLM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And yet, as some critics have observed, the fannish response to “On the Prowl” is very different to a vid like “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fanlore.org/wiki/Women%27s_Work&quot;&gt;Women’s Work&lt;/a&gt;,” also co-edited by Sisabet. Why do fans read “Women’s Work” as a strong exploration of violence against women in the media whereas “On the Prowl” performs similar violence against men yet isn’t read within the fan community in the same way? Is violence against women deplorable yet violence against men acceptable? Are primarily female slash vid fans only offended when the bodies bloodied and cut open are women? I’d suggest there’s something else at play, namely the identity of the victims. For anyone not deeply familiar with the show, it is initially difficult to recognize “Women’s Work” as a Supernatural vid. Most of the images are of female victims, monsters, or both that appear only briefly on the show. In other words, these characters are defined almost exclusively by the images of violence showcased in “Women’s Work.” (Being defiled and killed is, as the title wryly suggests, their JOB.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, even though “On the Prowl” draws from over 60 shows, most media fans will recognize a fair number of the characters if not the exact shots, because they tend to be the protagonists! Not only is their suffering often meaningful to the narrative and the character development, they also rarely are characterized only in terms of it. The scenes where our heroes are bound, beaten, and bloodied quite often lead to their rescue, recovery, and revenge. And even the self harm, the half dozen shots of guys trying to eat their guns, must be read in this context: after all, viewers only connect emotionally with a character trying to commit suicide if we care about their life and understand what would bring them to the edge. After all, the suffering men featured in “On the Prowl” are the heroes of their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Beyond the gender difference, however, the narrative thrust of the two vids is quite different. “On the Prowl” has a clear direction, where the violence intensifies, the tension increases, resulting in a crescendo of sound, images, and our responses. “Women’s Work,” on the other hand, offers two equally limited and equally harmful aspects of the representation of women in Supernatural (and, by extension, arguably in much of the media we consume): suffering victim or suffering monster, but never suffering hero. The first half of “Women’s Work” collects scared and tortured women, some of whose violent deaths (like Sam’s girlfriend and Sam and Dean’s mother) are the driving impetus for much of the series. The second half focuses on equally undercharacterized women who represent the monsters and villains the brothers fight against, and who are set up to be deservedly attacked and murdered. Like the madonna/whore dichotomy of old, this vid reminds us that usually only a few very narrowly defined roles are available for women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With its focus on male characters, “On the Prowl” flips this narrative on its head. Most of the showcased bloodied tortured heroes are at the center of their shows and films, their excerpted scenes but a tiny part of a complex plot line and portrayal. We care as much about these specific characters suffering as we do about what they endure. We clearly know they survive, because we watch their shows, but even if they ultimately die in canon, we know there will be thousands of stories to revive them. Just like each fanfic is more meaningful because it resonates with canon and all the other stories we have read, so canon itself gains potential through all the fan stories with their myriad endings and alternate worlds that fandom has created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;banner&quot; id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After the frantic succession of ever more painful images, the final shot is almost anti-climactic. It also is the only moment in the vid that clearly features a woman. I have to admit that I tend to overlook that scene. Marion Ravenwood tenderly kisses  Indiana Jones after he catalogues all his bruises and injuries for her. This concluding image  creates an emotional counterpoint to the previous frenzy and brings an all too brief moment of comfort to a litany of hurt. And it is clearly important that it is a woman here, all but standing in for us fangirls. If Lydia Lunch provides the fangirl narrative throughout the vid, it is Marion who enters the screen to provide comfort to our battered heroes. And yet I realize as I’m confronting this scene again and again that this may be my personal line in the vid. Ironically, it isn’t the torture or the blood, it isn’t the suicidal ideation or the fingernail–it is the move from me as outside observer to acknowledging my existence within the frames of the vid itself. Marion as “us”—acknowledging and barely comforting Indy—pulls me out because it puts me into it in a way I don’t like. I am too much of a hurt-comfort fan to not worry about my own investment and responsibility in this brutal exhibition of pain for my pleasures. My refusal to engage with the scene, my discomfort with it suggests that the reality check of gender is where I finally draw my line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In 2009 and 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;/about/people/bradcpu&quot;&gt;BradCPU&lt;/a&gt; produced an ambitious programme called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vidder_Profile&quot;&gt;Vidder Profiles&lt;/a&gt;. He talked about it in 2012, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/423/289&quot;&gt;TWC&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t rehash here. I think it’s so interesting to hear voices of other vidders so, with his permission, I’ve included seven of his wonderful documentary shorts here. The playlist is on the next screen.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You can also watch each profile individually, paired with a playlist of the (available on Youtube) featured vids from each documentary. You can follow the link on each vidder name to find the original Vidder Profile posts on LJ.&lt;/p&gt;
